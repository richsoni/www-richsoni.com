Taping up a wrinkled picture of her  
On the dashboard of my van  
All the exits signs seem like a blur  
Imagine we are holding hands  

*Back in Sweet Grass County*  
*Is my one true love*  
*Yeah I know shes waitin' for me*  
*Even though I'm on the run*  

Ditched my car somewhere near Devils Tower  
At the South Dakota line  
Hitched a ride out there several hours  
Until I found a vacant sign  

*Back in Sweet Grass County*  
*Is my one true love*  
*Yeah i know shes waitin' for me*  
*Even though I'm on the run*  

Got myself a job in Cedar Rapids  
When I ran out of my cash  
Sweeping floors over at Cornell College  
With a fake name on my badge  

*Back in Sweet Grass County*  
*Is my one true love*  
*Yeah i know shes waitin' for me*  
*Even though I'm on the run*  

When she showed me the fourty five  
I wiped her prints off, and i left mine  

At trailer park in Little Falls  
I rent a bed for a couple bucks  
Man, I wish I could give her a call  
But, I don't want to press my luck  

*Back in Sweet Grass County*  
*Is my one true love*  
*Yeah i know shes waitin' for me*  
*Even though I'm on the run*
