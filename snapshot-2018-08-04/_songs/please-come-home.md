I've been waiting in the darkness all alone for so long  
I'm thinking I'm going insane  

I've got no idea when you'll come along  
And wonder if my waiting is in vain  

*Won't you please come home*  
*I'm tired of chewing on my bone*  
*If I wait any longer I'll surly moan*  
*Won't you please come home*  

I'm hungry, I'm thirsty and I need you to help  
Aint nothing I can do without you  

I'm restless, I'm wild and I'm ready to yelp  
I need some walking time outside with you  

*Won't you please come home*  
*I'm tired of chewing on my bone*  
*If I wait any longer I'll surly moan*  
*Won't you please come home*  

Oh oh head on back to our place  
I'm aching and yearning your warm embrace  

Don't care what you did, who you saw  
All I care is that you come back alright  

I miss you I love you I want you right here  
I want to snuggle and kiss you all night  

*Won't you please come home*  
*I'm tired of chewing on my bone*  
*If I wait any longer I'll surly moan*  
*Won't you please come home*
