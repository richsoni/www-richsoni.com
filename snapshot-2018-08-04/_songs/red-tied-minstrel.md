I'm-a red tied minstrel, roamin' from town to town  
I'm-a red tied minstrel, watch out when I'm around  
Uncles hide your nieces, when you hear my sound  

If you see me with your nieces, you gummed up steps ago  
If you see me with your nieces, I'll raise defiance pent deep below  
I'll bring them to your window, but its them that will take the stones and throw  

I'm-a red tied minstrel, cocked hat lookin' sharp  
I'm-a red tied minstrel, blowin' my silver harp  
I won't be round here long, soon I'll be in other parts  

If you see me with your nieces, pray it aint the last time you do  
If you see me with your nieces, pray they don't come along with my crew  
Don't blame me they where waiting for an excuse  

I'm-a red tied minstrel, roamin' from town to town  
I'm-a red tied minstrel, watch out when around  
Uncles hide your nieces, when you hear my sound
