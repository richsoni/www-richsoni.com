How come you don't get along with me  
How come you don't get along with me  
You don't even show a trace, of geniality  
How come you don't get along with me  

How come you try to make me cry  
How come you try to make me cry  
You work on my face until breaking my eye  
How come you try to make me cry  

How come you never say hello  
How come you never say hello  
You always race right past my window  
How come you never say hello  

How come you always acting smug  
How come you always acting smug  
Your the opposite of grace, I have never seen you shrug  
How come you always acting smug  

How come you make my wanna punch yo lip  
How come you make my wanna punch yo lip  
I'll whack you with a mace, I'll give your shirt a rip  
How come you make my want to punch your lip
