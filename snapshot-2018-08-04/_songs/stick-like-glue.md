Girl you know me  
Oh, for many years  
Long ago we let our hearts eclipse  
And, ever since then its like  

*Oh, a raging under toe*  
*Like oh, avalanches of snow*  
*Like oh, our love is strong its true*  
*Me and you, stick like glue baby*  

Always care free  
We can just chill out for days  
Yet it still seems  
Like we zoomed to the moon on a rocket ship  

*Oh, a raging under toe*  
*Like oh, avalanches of snow*  
*Like oh, our love is strong its true*  
*Me and you, stick like glue baby*  

Who says that we need to follow any rules  
One day they'll see  
That they've been schooled by our love  
going on like  

Its crazy, the way, the time keeps tick tocking by  
I am certain you wont disagree, our love its still, still so strong  

*Oh, a raging under toe*  
*Like oh, avalanches of snow*  
*Like oh, our love is strong its true*  
*Me and you, stick like glue baby*  

*Oh, a raging under toe*  
*Like oh, avalanches of snow*  
*Like oh, our love is strong its true*  
*Me and you, stick like glue baby*
