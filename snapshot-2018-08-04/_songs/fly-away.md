*Fly away into the sea breeze*  
*Spread your wings and fly away*  

*Footsteps in the sand wont be here tomorrow*  
*They will all be washed away be the sea*  

Born as a boardwalk ballerina  
Just a flip flopping along  
In the outskirts of the marina  
She gives it away for a song  

Back past the kitchen of the cantina  
Johnny fixed himself a nice little room  
Hell go back there with a few señoritas  
To gamble with fisherman from the lagoon  


He was a real son of a beach boy  
Renting a shack, by the sea  
Washed into town, with the driftwood  
After a bender in Carpi  

*Fly away into the sea breeze*  
*Spread your wings and fly away*  

*Footsteps in the sand wont be here tomorrow*  
*They will all be washed away be the sea*  

He was lookin' for something easy to do for the season  
Something for which he could bend up the rules  
He got mixed up with her for that reason  
They'd swimming around in neighborhood pools  

Well, word got back to Johnny that I was Sneakin'  
Around the town with his brown colored spoon  
I heard the boards behind me squeaking  
And they pull of the sack and I'm in the back of the saloon  

She said this place is so dead, in the winter  
After the seagulls cross over the town  
Don't drag his feet there gonna get spliters  
Down at the sound there's no one around  

*Fly away into the sea breeze*  
*Spread your wings and fly away*  

*Footsteps in the sand wont be here tomorrow*  
*They will all be washed away be the sea*
