When the eyes see their match  
And the lips beg to attach  
You sweet and forget, the treat  
Of the fire  

And your home all alone  
With your ear glued to the phone  
Oh babe  
Thats what i call love  

When everything you used to hate  
Suddenly lost all of its weight  
Babe, i think i know whats going on with that thing pumping between your lungs   

You see their name written in the clouds  
And their masquerader in the crowds  
Oh babe,  
Thats what i call love  

When you know that all the stars,  
Saturn Neptune and mars  
Couldn't hold all the happiness you feel  

And, Zeus' Aphrodite would say  
Your bond is majestic and mighty  
Oh babe,  
Thats what i call love  

Eclipsing sun and moon  
Clock hands at noon  
Seem askew when compared to you two together  

You will lick each others wounds  
Make sure each others strings are tuned  
Oh babe,  
Thats what i call love  

When you'd trade all 8 of your pawns  
For that single queen to lean on  
Valiantly facing 16 foes alone, together  

Through the ups and the downs  
Wearing straw hats or crowns  
Thats what I call love
