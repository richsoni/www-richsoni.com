Well, I always sit at the top of the rail road train  
Sittin' down low just aint the same, lord  
Sittin' down low just aint the same  

I sit a-facing backward with the window by my side  
Starin' at the fat words on the billboard signs  

I don't think theres a better way, no lord  
There aint no better way  

Well, I always sit at the top of the rail road train  
Sittin' down low would drive me insane  

I look into the cities as we stop at each  
See the towns where teachers teach and the priests preach  

I don't think theres a better way, no lord  
There aint no better way  

Well, I always sit at the top of the rail road train  
If all the seats are gone ill stand my friend  

Lookin' in the woods as we go between towns  
Watchin' rabbits, and the deer run all around  

I don't think theres a better way, no lord  
There aint no better way
