*Well, I always sit at the top when riding the railroad train*  
*Sittin' down low just aint the same, lord*  
*Sittin' down low just aint the same*  

I sit a-facing backward with the window by my side  
Staring at the fat words on the billboard signs  

I don't think there's a better way, no lord  
No, there aint no better way  

*Well, I always sit at the top when riding the railroad train*  
*Sittin' down low would drive me insane*  
*Sittin' down low would drive me insane*  

I look into the cities as we stop at each  
See the towns where teachers teach and the preachers preach  

I don't think there's a better way, no lord  
No, there aint no better way  

*Well, I always sit at the top when riding the railroad train*  
*If all the seats are gone ill stand my friend*  
*If all the seats are gone ill stand my friend*  

Lookin' in the woods as we go between towns  
Watching rabbits, and the deer a-running all around  

I don't think there's a better way, no lord  
No, there aint no better way
