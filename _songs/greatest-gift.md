Not a coat of many colors, gold frankincense or myrrh  
Not a hundred thousand dollars, or a ship of tiger furs  
Not a genie's wishes granted: four or three or two  
Not even an enchantment, to keep the sky above me blue  

Baby,  Cant you see  
I know you don't always believe it  
But, your the greatest gift that can be  

Not leading a million soldiers, with an aristeia glow  
Not the world falling on my shoulders, saving it from a lethal blow  
Not an Archimedes lever, makin' me extra strong,  
Not living for forever, unless you could come along  

Baby,  Cant you see  
I know you don't always believe it  
But, your the greatest gift that can be  

Not having some sort of Mozart, write me a set of quartets  
Not my nemesis falling short, in a game of Russian roulette  
Not speaking tongues of every culture, Hawaiian, Wolof, and Thai  
Not a copper plated sculpture, 150 storeys high  

Baby,  Cant you see  
I know you don't always believe it  
But, your the greatest gift that can be
