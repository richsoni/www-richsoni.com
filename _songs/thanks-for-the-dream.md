Thanks for the dream  
A brief scene of what could have been  
An *if*, a *where*, a *You & Me*, darlin'  
Thanks for the dream  

A scene that could have been  
Painted on a silver screen  
But, circumstance was unforeseen  
So, thanks for the dream  

*When I close my eyes*  
*You're with me besides the fact that you'll never be back*  
*You're just lost in the deep blue sea*  

Thanks for the dream  
Another world, that I can see  
Within my vault of memories  
Thanks for the dream  

An *if*, a *where*, a *You & Me*  
Imaginary jubilee  
For, this affair could never be  
But, thanks for the dream  

Thanks for the dream  
A brief scene of what could have been  
An *if*, a *where*, a *You & Me*, darlin'  
Thanks for the dream
