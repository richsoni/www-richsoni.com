Oh the waitress hung her apron
And she's smoking outside
And the fathers with their daughters
Left their dishes behind
But, we're still at the bar
Drinking our troubles away
Cuz, tomorrow might be Monday
But, tonight is still Saturday

Oh, the silver in my pocket
Its the last to my name
And, I'll wake up in the morning
A broke man once again
So, come all you good time people
And drink up my chardonnay
Cuz, tomorrow might be Monday
But, tonight is still Saturday

I'll play my fiddle
By the snug turf glow
If your brother like me
He can leave me alone
Cuz, Even the dour cripple
Is dancing his troubles away
Sayin' Tomorrow might be Monday
But, tonight is still Saturday

Maybe your a sailor
Bound for hell at the dawn
Or Your, workin' for McAlpine
Slugging dirt to the hod
Or your lovely like Becky Cooper
And your looking for a warm place to lay
Well, tomorrow might be Monday
But, tonight is still Saturday
