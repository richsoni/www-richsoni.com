Nuclear bombs blowin' venomous air  
Feel that fallout dust getting stuck in my hair  
Looking for safety, lookin' for a place to survive  
But, in this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide  

History books don't tell it so well  
See, this whole damn world is a living hell  
Mountains of people everywhere, knock one and it'll start to slide  
In this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide  

Can't go to dinner, cant see a motion film  
Even your commute to work could be the time that you are killed  
You can get shot down while listening to rock music amplified  
In this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide  

There's armies forming everywhere, they aint tied to sovereignty  
They just people who hate others living free  
It could be your neighbor, it could be a woman dressed like a bride  
In this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide  

Ideas polluting everyone, we all subscribe to some  
Some call to not hurt anyone, others to bang a battle drum  
Each gathering followers, getting stronger than the tide  
In this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide
