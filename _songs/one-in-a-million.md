If I had to ask you where the rain starts
you'd say where a drop falls onto you
you act like the line starts just at your back love
there aint line on the corner of 8th avenue

I hate to break it to you babe
its hard to explain this
Your just one in a million
and one in million aint hard to miss

is it true that you think that in the evening
everyone goes to sleep because you do
you think they think the world would be boring
unless your awake to j:w


I bet that fortune 5 hunder ed corporation
really can feel it when you are gone
there all sitting around counting seconds
waiting for you to finish listening to this song

I hate to break it to you babe
its hard to explain this
Your just one in a million
and one in million aint hard to miss

you missed it when you where too busy for the last party
there was a couple just curious about what you eat
they wish you would snap them a picture
and send it to them so there mind could just be at ease

even your mother, she was saying your stories
all sounded just like an old friend of hers
in fact now that she really thinks about it
youve nothing which which even in small talk deserves

I hate to break it to you babe
its hard to explain this
Your just one in a million
and one in million aint hard to miss

despite what you think about mona lisa
she's lookin at me no less than she is you
theres a funny thing you should know about lisa
eh, nevermind youll just tell me it isnt true

I hate to break it to you babe
its hard to explain this
Your just one in a million
and one in million aint hard to miss
