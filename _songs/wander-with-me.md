I can't tell you where we're going  
I can't say where we'll end up  
Like doves in the wind a-blowin'  
Searching for a place to slump  

If its true life has a meaning  
Its locked in a safe by Eternity  
Understand there's no machining  
That can forge the swallowed key  

*My advise is to stop searching*  
*And come wander with me*  
*Our paths our surly merging*  
*So come wander with me*  

Babe the Big and The Yazoo river  
They never ponder or expect  
They rely on gravity to delivers  
Them to the place where they connect  

And, the water flowing downward  
May be headed toward the sea  
Yet a lake that it encounters  
May be where it wants to be  

*My advise is to stop searching*  
*And come wander with me*  
*Our paths our surly merging*  
*So come wander with me*  

So if you want to walk together  
I welcome you with an open hand  
I'm sure well face all kinds of weather  
But united we will stand  

*My advise is to stop searching*  
*And come wander with me*  
*Our paths our surly merging*  
*So come wander with me*
