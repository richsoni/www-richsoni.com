Sarah Ruth, you snap those beans ill snap yo bone  
Sarah Ruth, man id be better off alone  
I smell like Bourbon, well you smell like sermon  
Sarah Ruth  

Sarah Ruth, i was broken down the highway  
Sarah Ruth, next thing you know we gettin' married  
Hates my tattoos, aint that what you are  
Sarah Ruth  

Sarah Ruth, i was on the field on morning  
Sarah Ruth, i crashed my tractor without warning  
You where on my mind, i coulda went blind  
Sarah Ruth  

Sarah Ruth, i didn't realize I was already blind  
Sarah Ruth, now i left all my mistakes behind  
I found the lord, the one you adore  
Sarah Ruth  

Sarah Ruth, don't you see i did this for you  
Sarah Ruth, i proudly wear this big tattoo  
You think its profane, you think lewd  
Sarah Ruth  

Sarah Ruth, now i sit outside our home  
Sarah Ruth, with a bloody face cold as a stone  
Beat me with a broom and sent me on  
Sarah Ruth
