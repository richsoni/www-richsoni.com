Ridin' along the great green mountains  
The heart of the Appellation range  
I know claim the grass could be greener  
But lord today I cant complain  

One thing that I learned from these mountains  
Gazin' upon them covered with snow  
Is show every piece green you got  
Even if theres frost down below  

We could meet up in those mountains  
Say we go to Bennington town  
stand at the top of the monument
with the mountains in every direction round  

Or, maybe we can head up to Rutland  
Where the mountains roll up to the sky  
We could climb to see the range there  
Its green no matter how far you stretch your eye  

Some people may say that I'm crazy  
Wakin' at the roosters first crow  
And walking along these great mountains  
But, my reply is some folks was born to never know
