Your father was a railroad man  
Wine glass fixed in his hand  
Back then this land was their land  
Amelia  

Little red plane swishing by  
Cries, rise above the rock island line  
In the air your heart must fly  
Amelia  

*Amelia, watching her go*  
*Casting a shadow on the water below*  
*Singing a song on Noah's great rainbow*  
*How much they love you Amelia you'll never know*  

Traveling with nothing except her wit  
Hershey bar and two handkerchiefs   
All just to get a little more lift  
Amelia  

Smiling stepping onto the ground  
Flash photography all around  
Catching the queen of the air being crowned  
Amelia  

*Amelia, watching her go*  
*Casting a shadow on the water below*  
*Singing a song on Noah's great rainbow*  
*How much they love you Amelia you'll never know*  

Spark so bright and wick so short  
Lonesome Bessie the Fire Horse  
Realized that she'll never soar  
Without Amelia  

Every year on The Fourth of July  
I hear a hollering in the sky  
Almost can see her wobbling by  
Amelia  

*Amelia, watching her go*  
*Casting a shadow on the water below*  
*Singing a song on Noah's great rainbow*  
*How much they love you Amelia you'll never know*
