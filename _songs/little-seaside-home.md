When I bought that house and ship, I was young and full of zip,  
left my my friends and family back in old Bayonne.  
And so I made the race, and I staked me out a place  
And settled down along a tidal zone  

*It flowed away, it flowed away*  
*My little Seaside home it flowed away*  
*I was living on a prayer when I built my shanty there.*  
*Everything except my mortgage flowed away*  

I got this broken boat, and I fixed it up to float  
Aimed to have Sawmill slice to feed my face  
When I was done I tied the bow to the dock outside the house  
And I knew that I had finally found my place  

*It flowed away, it flowed away*  
*That ship that I fixed up flowed away*  
*When the Atlantic had its panic it went down like The Titanic*  
*All the pieces of my ship they flowed away*  

My banana stand, lost to the roving sand  
The stock is probably down in old VA  
All the cash inside sailed down Route 35  
My Banana  shop in seaside flowed away  

*It flowed away, it flowed away*  
*Everything I owned flowed away*  
*I hollered and I cussed when my stand went with a thrust*  
*When my business that I own, it flowed away*  

I was living on a prayer when I built my shanty there.  
I figured I was all set for all my life.  
So up hopped into my woody and went looking for a goody  
But, I found myself a puggle, and not a wife  

*He flowed away, he flowed away*  
*My Jersey Shore pup he flowed away*  
*I leaned on down to pet him, but I saw that he could swim*  
*My jersey shore puggle flowed away*  

Then I was left alone a-listenin' to the moan  
Of the sea around the corners of my shack  
So I took off down the road when the ocean water flowed  
A-travelin' with the waves cracking at my back  

*I flowed away, I flowed away*  
*Mantoloking bridge was up ahead*  
*I was living on a prayer as I saw my shanty tear*  
*My house its settled in the ocean bed*  

Now I'm always close to home no matter where I roam,  
For those waters spread all across the land  
Makes no difference where I'm walkin', I can hear my ship a-rockin'  
I can hear that puggle a-barkin' in the air  

*It flowed away,  it flowed away*  
*My little seaside home it flowed away*  
*But my home is always near; its in the waters clear*  
*My little seaside home it flowed away*  

I'm a writ of right New Jersyite, but we don't need to reunite   
And Ill never get homesick 'til I die.  
No matter where I'm found, my home is all around;  
My seaside home is wherever it rains, or water lies  

*It flowed away, it flowed away,*  
*My shanty down at exit 82*  
*But all around the world, wherever sand is whirled*  
*Some is what my seaside home broke into*  

*It flowed away, it flowed away,*  
*My little seaside home it flowed away*  
*Its over in the sea where the waves are rolling free*  
*My little seaside home it flowed away*
