Seven days, is way too long  
I cant see your face, and baby thats so so wrong  
I love you dear, Wish you where here  

Another week of goodbyes, more tears in our eyes  
Another week of sighs, on the lonely nights  
But i love you dear, wish you where here  

If i could run back home, find you in your room alone  
Pull you up into my arms keep you from the worlds harm  
Look you in the eyes and say....  

Oh its over now  
What goes up always comes down  
Even when, even when, even when its not the best  
I say amen I say amen because the both of us are blessed  

Another fight, baby thats not right  
We went off like a kite, I could make it alright if I said  
I love you dear, and thats sincere  

Now your walking away, and thats not ok  
I really want you to stay  
But its too late to say  
I love you dear, just stay here  

If i could run back home, find you in your room alone  
Pull you up into my arms keep you from the worlds harm  
Look you in the eyes and say....  

Oh its over now  
What goes up always comes down  
Even when, even when, even when its not the best  
I say amen I say amen because the both of us are blessed  

Turn that frown upside down  
Make a sad song a happy sound  
Sometimes love comes around  
Lets turn this thing back around  
Sometimes even the best have a break down  

Oh its over now  
What goes up always comes down  
Even when, even when, even when its not the best  
I say amen I say amen because the both of us are blessed  

Oh its over now  
What goes up always comes down  
Even when, even when, even when its not the best  
I say amen I say amen because the both of us are blessed
