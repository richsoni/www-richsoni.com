When you slammed the door  
And left me all alone  
Kneeling on the floor  
I couldn't help but moan  

Since you've been gone  
I've been waitin'  
I really want you to know  
My wrist is resting  
Against a stormy window  

You really shook me up  
Nothin' seems the same  
I've gut a tangle of guts  
With a sinking pain  

You left me stranded  
Shaking, tired  
Bitter, weary, and low  
I've been fearing the world  
Outside the stormy window  

Baby, darlin', honey, dear  
I want you back with me here  
Birds a-chirpin', sunshine a-smilin'  
Breezes blowin' but I'm stuck a-cryin'  
Pushing my palms  
Against the stormy window  

I know your gone for good  
Its settled into my mind  
Still the crack in my heart  
Is pounding colder than ice  

I've gone crazy, I've gone nuts  
Why cant I just start hating your guts  
I'm banging my head  
On a stormy window
