Ive been waiting in the darkness all alone for so long  
I'm thinking I'm going insane  

Ive got no idea when you'll come along  
And wonder if my waiting is in vain  

Wont you please come home  
I'm tired of chewing on my bone  
If I wait any longer ill surly moan  
Wont you please come home  

I'm hungry, I'm thirsty and I need you to help  
Aint nothing I can do without you  

I'm restless, I'm wild and I'm ready to yelp  
I need some walking time outside with you  

Wont you please come home  
I'm tired of chewing on my bone  
If I wait any longer ill surly moan  
Wont you please come home  

Oh oh head on back to our place  
I'm aching and yearning your warm embrace  

Don't care what you did, who you saw  
All I care is that you come back alright  

I miss you I love you I want you right here  
I want to snuggle and kiss you all night
