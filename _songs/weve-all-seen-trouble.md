title: We've All Seen Trouble

When the lime lite is shining  
And, the queen of clubs is dining  
At the five star joint, and the shift lead has appointed you  
Who has no clue how to do a waiters job  

You trip over your shoe and spill the glue colored stew  
And, the queen's cold black eyes stare right through your taboo  
But don't you feel blue, jack  

*Everybody has had a ball that they fumbled*  
*Everybody's been a rock on the tumble*  
*So, next time you see somebody walkin' take a stumble*  
*Just try to be humble*  
*We all see trouble*  

When Tweedle Dee begins to hum a drum beat  
He taps his feet, and the side of his seat with the meat of his thumb  
And, as he goes numb the gum shoots from  
His rum gullet onto the back of your mullet  
But neither your nor him should feel dumb  
When your at your interview you notice and feel like a bum  

*Everybody has had a ball that they fumbled*  
*Everybody's been a rock on the tumble*  
*So, next time you see somebody walkin' take a stumble*  
*Just try to be humble*  
*We all see trouble*  

When that lonesome whistle sounds and the train is leaving town  
And you start to make a frown because on a whim you left Tiny Tim  
Back at the station don't worry Jim  
You where just hurryin'  

*Everybody has had a ball that they fumbled*  
*Everybody's been a rock on the tumble*  
*So, next time you see somebody walkin' take a stumble*  
*Just try to be humble*  
*We all see trouble*
