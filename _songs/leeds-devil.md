Em G C

Siren voice is screaming
cloven tail, hoof, and horn
all the midwives weeping
the Leeds devil's just been born

---

In the silt of Mullica River
on a dark and stormy eve
mother Leeds' haunches quiver
she sops her sweet with her sleeve

Though, she's aint a rook to birthin' babies
having twelve within her brood
still she called all the local ladies
to do their dance and set the mood

Siren voice is screaming
cloven tail, hoof, and horn
all the midwives weeping
the Leeds devil's just been born

They all gathered in a circle
smiled at the newborn in the room
but then their blood began to curdle
as his mangled legs grew and grew

The boy, they all had just been holding
now had a goats head and some claws
his eyes where red and they are bulging
his wingspan shred up all the gauze

Siren voice is screaming
cloven tail, hoof, and horn
all the midwives weeping
the Leeds devil's just been born

Thrashing all about the cabin
he took his mothers fragile soul
through the chimney wings where flapping
knocking down the lightning pole

To this day if you wander
to far within the piney trees
beware of shadows moving yonder
pray to god to spare your knees

Siren voice is screaming
cloven tail, hoof, and horn
all the midwives weeping
the Leeds devil's just been born
