Well, I think I'll call you late march snow  
Because I want you to leave but you just wont go  
Do you really need me to say it?  
Why do you have to delay it?  

Well, don't you realize that I'm sick of the cold  
And dreaming of heat is really getting old  
Can't you just take the hint?  
Do you need it in print?  

*Please baby its time for you to go*  
*Please baby you have reached the end of the show*  

Well it was fun to to ride my sleigh  
But now I'm tired and I don't want to play  
Wont you just leave me alone?  
Cant you just throw me a bone?  

Have you guzzled down a rum barrel of coffee  
Are you on some kind of pills, because tonight you seem oftly  
Gee your throat must be sore  
Do you need me to show you the door?  

*Please baby its time for you to go*  
*Please baby you have reached the end of the show*
