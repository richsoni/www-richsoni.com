enslaved in killala(caun chill ala) bay
paddy sheared the sheep and bagged the hay
but he was getting kind of board
of wailing to the lord
until all his bids where cured one rainy day

the lord fell into paddys dream
said, listen man you want to split the scene
swing over to the dock
just after two o'clock
talk with mr. smee about our scheme

so, he hitched a ride to alba isle
but found that place was draggin on his style
he took a shot of gin, dove in the sea to swim
cuz saints dont wander far from sin

pastor preaches jesus said forgive
thats the way he urges us to live
read luke four and twenty times
dont challenge him on lines from simon, simon-peter, paul, or john

miss moses had a knack for wrong and right
she never fought remorse late in the night
she always finds disgust, starts a verbal gust
must someone lust less just sustenance in life

without those less angelic than they are
those left aint quote unquote a star
then they all would look so dim, and none of them would win
so, saints dont wander far from sin

see everyone commits a little crime
human's misconstrue from time to time
expect someone to grin when they smack you in the shin
cuz, saints dont wander far from sin
