early in the morning
while the captain's snoring
grab my hat
and start exploring

sipping on a tea
sip it by the sea
i have to go, wait another 3

it aint a crime, im just another dime
to the nursery rhyme
of mr your not on time

as he licks his lips
gives his cuffs a twist
but, i wont let him slap my wrist

hes a cactus thorn
if my pants are torn
but, all his scorn
is just a joke to me

im just blowing rings
hes typing things
never knew the sping
was even coming

ill be marching on
before the sun is gone
he thinks its wrong
i think its funny
