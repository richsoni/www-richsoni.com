peggy will you ever know my name
peggy will you ever know my name
i learned yours from the coffee cup that your holdin in your hand

peggy will you ever play with me
peggy will you ever play with me
you stick my bubble gum in mind come play with me

peggy will you ride the ferris wheel
peggy will you ride the ferris wheel
goes nowhere, but the ride is such a thrill

---

peggy will you ever make me cry
peggy will you ever make me cry
whats the point of livin if you aint willin to even try

peggy will you settle down with me
peggy will you settle down with me
where are you runnin to everything is all the same
