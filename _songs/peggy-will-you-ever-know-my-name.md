Peggy will you ever know my name  
Peggy will you ever know my name  
I learned yours from the coffee cup in your hand  

Peggy will you ever play with me  
Peggy will you ever play with me  
You stick my bubble gum in mind come play with me  

Peggy will you ride the Ferris Wheel  
Peggy will you ride the Ferris Wheel  
Goes nowhere, but the ride is such a thrill  

Peggy will you ever make me cry  
Peggy will you ever make me cry  
Whats the point of livin' if you aint willin' to even try  

Peggy will you settle down with me  
Peggy will you settle down with me  
Where are you runnin' to everything is all the same
