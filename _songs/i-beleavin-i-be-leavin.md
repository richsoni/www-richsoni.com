I believin'', I be leavin'' in the morning  
I believin'', I be leavin'' you behind  
I be leavin'', cuz I believin'' you been exploring  
I be leavin', cuz I believin' you thinks I'm blind  

I believin', I be leavin' cuz I feel so doggone lonesome  
I believin', I be leavin' you alone  
I be leavin', cuz I believin' you vows a broken  
I be leavin', and I be leavin' to go and roam  

Sometimes life it gives you lemons  
That you can squeeze in someones eye  
So go ahead attack my with your venom  
Ill have to go ahead and try  

I believin', I be leavin' my darlin'  
I believin', I be leavin' her seemin' blue  
I be leavin', cuz I believin' you just charming  
To find another man without a clue
