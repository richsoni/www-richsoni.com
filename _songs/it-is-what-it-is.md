i get a low down feeling
thinkin bout all the evil that i see
theres people dying
just tryin to be free

this aint a world
to raise kids
but, it is what it is

im just doin me
tryin to keep on keepin on
all the news that i see
lookin a lot like the letters of john

this aint a world
that the angels kiss
but, it is what it is

haters gonna hate
gonna hate their way into a war
the angel at heavens gate will be
all like what was it you where fighting for?

this aint a world
asking for clenching fists
but, it is what it is

this aint a world
where it should be mine or his
but, it is what it is
