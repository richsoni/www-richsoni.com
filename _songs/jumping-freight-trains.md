I was riding on the ghost line  
Strumming a lonesome chord  
Never had so much time  
Yet never been so bored  

I took my guitar, and painted its pick guard blue  
Honey, i was jumping freight trains until i found you  

I traveled through the backwoods  
Slept beneath the stars  
Felt so lonesome as i stood  
Alone in the engine yard  

I was looking for an answer, but i didn't have a single clue  
Honey, i was jumping freight trains until i found you  

Ive been up all night with gamblers  
Lost to aces backed with 8s  
Shuffling all my colors  
But, couldn't get them straight  

I went face up with a pair of when I should have just withdrew  
Honey, i was jumping freight trains until i found you  

On the rocky road to Dublin  
I worked only to eat  
I couldn't find a place  
Where I could rest my feet  

Blurring my mind with good old mountain dew  
Honey, i was jumping freight trains until i found you  

I was a lackey on a sailboat  
To a curly mustached pirate fixed on crime  
He was slitting innocent throats  
I was hauling the bow line  

I was just a member of a marooned and dirty crew  
Honey, i was jumping freight trains until i met you  

I was shacking in Gamorrah  
Watching the filth slither by  
Washing feet for some Poobah  
While he made his daughters cry  

I just made out when the brimstone began to accrue  
Honey, i was jumping freight trains before i met you  

Every time id find a road  
It would lead me astray  
Banging on a rusty compass  
Trusting it to guide my way  

Now its found a north thats true  
Honey, i was jumping freight trains before i met you  

Ever since we met  
The fog has drifted past  
I never will regret  
The love we have will ever last  

Sticking by your side like rubber glue  
Honey, i was jumping freight trains before i met you
