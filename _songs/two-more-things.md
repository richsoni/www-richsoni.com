two more things id like to try
before aeee-i lay down and die
the first is to look you in the eye
and the other is to tell yo-o-o-u goodbye

so, I walk to the top of yourrr doorrrstep
I knock, knock onnnn the door
You father he does answer
You aint alive no mo'

three more golden links of chain
until at last I learn-n-n my name
woke up to the drizzling rain
around the curve there cammme-a pain

the lady in red she is crying
she puts all the willows to shame
you say that you dont mind a-dying
but, your kids theylll be rolling in pain
 --

four high aces in your hand
dont make you no less of a man
armies and fools at your command
cant slow down the speed of the sand

an angel fell down from the heavens
he bought her a nine dollar shawl
he'll show you the bend if you let him
he'll dress you like la belle et la ball

Cresting to the summit of the hill
Theres a man in the ruins of a mill
Trade a pole for a fourty dollar bill
never worked and you never will

hero was lying this second
She rarely is telling the truth
It will dig at your sould if you let it
Itl kill you like boothe in the booth
