I made my way down to the love station  
Got myself a ticket to ride  
But I was met with procrastination  
When the announcer came on the line  

*Please standby*  
*Please standby*  
*Well I aint gonna lie*  
*There's a delay so please standby*  

I asked 'What's the cause of the delay honey,  
Is the engine broke in need of repair  
Can I assist in any way sugar  
Do you need me to stick my wrench in there'  
All she said was...  

*'Please standby*  
*Please standby*  
*Well I aint gonna lie*  
*There's a delay so please standby'*  

She said 'this route only has one lane and there's another train stuck on the track'  
I said 'I feel her pain, I don't mean to complain but when will service be back'  
She said 'I don't know I cannot lie  
The priorities are high  
I really will try'  
Then I gave her a sigh  
As she looked in my eye  
And said 'until then please stand by  

*Please standby*  
*Please standby*  
*Well I aint gonna lie*  
*There's a delay so please standby'*
