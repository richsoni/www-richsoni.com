A                     G
fly away into the sea breeze
spread your wings and fly away

footsteps in the sand wont be here tomorrow
they will all be washed away be the sea

A         G         A          D
born as a boardwalk ballerina
A         G         E          F#
just a flip flopping along
in the outskirts of the marina
she gives it away for a song

back past the kitchen of the cantina
jefe fixed himself a nice little room
hell go back there with a few senoritas
to gamble with fisherman from the lagoon


he was a real son of a beach boy
renting a shack, by the sea
washed into town, with the driftwood
after a bender in carpi

(chorus)

he was lookin for something easy to do for the season
something for which he could bend up the rules
he got mixed up with her for that reason
they'd sneak around swimming in neighborhood pools

well, word got back to the jefe that I was sneakin
around the town with his brown colored spoon
I heard the boards behind me squeaking
and they pull of the sack and im in the back of the saloon

she said this place is so dead, in the winter
after the seagulls cross over the town
dont drag his feet there gonna get spliters
down at the sound theres no one around
