Strawberry jam in my bed  
Smeared upon a slice of wonder bread  

Wonder i needn't as I lean it toward my head  
Of the allure it has when its spread  

---

Strawberry jam when I'm squealing bored  
Just a little lick and I'm feeling cured  

Not a thing is like the tart and sweet taste  
Both when its bare or when its laced  

---

Strawberry jam upon my lips  
I scoop it with my fingertips  

Like a honey sucklin' bear  
I can smell its fragrance in the air  

---

Strawberry Jam in the dawn
Slip it in during a yawn
Strawberry Jam in the night
doesnt take a heavy bite

So i heard she wants to hang with me  
Come with that jam by the snoozin' tree  

Hey girl did you hear about what I like  
Feed me some jam and you can ride my bike
