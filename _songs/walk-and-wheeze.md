Bent my hat
Lost my keys
Fuss with my woman
Dogs got fleas
Wading in water straight passed my knees
Thats the way it goes sometimes
Walk and wheeze

Walking high
Walking low
Walking cuz I got no place to go
Dont have a second to feel the breeze
Thats the way it goes sometimes
Walk and wheeze

Pressures down
Boss is gone
Found some babka he can...drizzle on
Still I work till I got swollen knees
Thats the way it goes sometimes
Walk and wheeze

Passed a bottle
Passed a stone
Passed a woman sitting all alone
Passed a chance to sail the seven seas
Thats the way it goes sometimes
Walk and wheeze
