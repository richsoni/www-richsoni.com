em       am           g      bm
its just another busy night
          c      bm         g
trying to answer all of the questions in my mind

it gets so discouraging sometimes
but then again thats what makes its worth while to be alive

g        bm    am
an inner medly
        d
that we hear inside our mind
yours is yours
and mine is mine
an inner medly
an inner medly

it keeps me guessing all the time
is there anything wrong with an undescriptive line

is doing nothing a such a crime
is there anyone who can answer better anytime than

an inner medly
that we hear inside our mind
yours is yours
and mine is mine
an inner medly
