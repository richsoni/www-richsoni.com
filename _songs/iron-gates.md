From the iron gates  
I can see outside  
I can see the freight, trains pass by  

*And the day will come*  
*I cannot even wait*  
*When a tap my drum*  
*Outside these iron gates*  

There's a crack in the wall  
I stash some paper within  
The screw turns back down the hall  
I jot down a poem  

*And the day will come*  
*I cannot even wait*  
*When I tap on my drum*  
*Outside these iron gates*  

On these iron gates  
I clink my old cup  
I pretend its a bad dream  
And I cannot wake up  

*And the day will come*  
*I cannot even wait*  
*When I tap on my drum*  
*Outside these iron gates*
