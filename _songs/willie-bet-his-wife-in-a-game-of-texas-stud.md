Willie bet his wife
in a game of Texas Stud
He had nothing more to loose
to the hand of Mr. Mudd

In his yard there was a garden
His true love she was there
He put her in the wagon
and took her to the square

Bonnie took the hand
Of the man she truly loved
And, she left that Willie Gold
Without even one last hug

In his yard there was a garden
And, Willie burnt it bare
Shotgun in the wagon
He drove down to the square

Mudd he had a hand
of aces flyin' high
He looked at Willie Gold
Straight in the suckers eye

His love was in the garden
She rigged the deck of hards
She knew Willie would bargain
With the love that chained her heart

Standing in the square
Of The Old Dog Saloon
Shotgun in his hand
He sent em' to the tomb

In his yard there was a garden
His true love she was there
Set beneath her Mudd
With roses in her hair
