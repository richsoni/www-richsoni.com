Good god, I'm falling over  
To the place where I've been before  
Cut past the bosses shoulder  
Hit the tracks then the liquor store  

Can't keep my feet from blowing  
I need a paperweight to hold me down  
Settle to a place then I'm up and going  
Aint no work for me left in this town  

*Hahahahahaha*  
*I'm a waste of life*  

Take a look, take a really good look  
I'm just the guy you've been trying to find  
There aint a job that I haven't took  
There aint a job for which I'm qualified  

Six weeks is the time it takes them  
For their senses to adapt to me  
Meanwhile, I just keep stinkin  
Till their noses catch up to me  

*Hahahahahaha*  
*I'm a waste of life*  

Met a chick on a bus to Miami  
She bought me liquor and she bought me food  
She put me up in her masters pantry  
It was strange but I couldn't be rude  

Met a chick at a bar in LA  
I bail her out and she bails me too  
I left once, but I can't keep away  
We drink port till our brains are stew  

*Hahahahahaha*  
*I'm a waste of life*
