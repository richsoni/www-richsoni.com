I have heard it 1000 times if not more.
Success is an accident.
For every 100 things you do, one is bound to be a success.
This can be true with songs, relationships, jobs, etc.
I know, and believe this.

While listening to the Tim Ferriss podcast with Seth Godin, my mind wandered to these questions:

1. Where would I like to be failing?
1. Am I failing enough at it?

Having answers to these questions is important to know at all times.
