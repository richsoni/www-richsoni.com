[Netlify] is gaining popularity as an alternative to [Github Pages] for hosting static sites.
One of my first posts on this site, '[How I Use Github Pages to Host My Blog]' documented my experience using [Github Pages] to host my site.
That was back in 2013, and a lot has changed since then both on this site, and in technology offerings.

In this post, I am going to work through launching a parallel build of my site on [Netlify].
This will allow me to evaluate it as an alternative to hosting via Github pages.
