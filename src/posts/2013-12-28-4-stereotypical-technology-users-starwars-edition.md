We all know people, or may even ourselves, fall into certain stereotypes regarding technology use.  
One can easily place friends and relations into their respective compartments within the [diffusion of innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations) graph.  
However, this model is a bit dry for discussing over a beer with friends.  

Instead, I offer a new model based upon comparing personal technology outlooks to those of our favorite star wars characters.

# 1. Jawa ( The Scavenger )

> ~ Uncle Owen

Its upgrade day in the office.  
Everyone is getting a new machine, and the old ones are getting thrown out.  
This guy/gal asks the boss how much they could purchase the lot for.  
After purchasing 100 of the same model laptop, they clean up each and wipe the hard drive, and then sell it on eBay.  

This same person will take your old iPod or cell phone, fix it up and use it.  

Like the Jawa they jump for joy when they are given some old technology junk that they can either use or sell.  

This person will drive around on garbage day listening to [Rag and Bone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLcnPZbnX5c), and look for old computers that where thrown out.  

Don't laugh to hard though, all you Non-Jawas, because this person knows a lot more than the average person about technology, and has made a hefty sum of cash in the process.

# 2. Boba Fett ( the gargoyle )

In [Snow Crash]("https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBJCJE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000FBJCJE&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20") by Neal Stephenson, gargoyles are people that wear body suits of technology to submerge themselves into the 'internet' world within the story.  
This reminds me a lot of Boba Fett because I picture gargoyles to look similar to him.  

Boba Fett is really into his gear.  
He has his jet pack, blaster, helmet, and countless tools attached to his armor.  

In our society, this is the person with 2 phones ( both always open ), an iPad, and if they are baller, a Google Glass.  
They are the bona fide early adopter, and gadget collector.  

This person will buy a [Fitbit]("https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0095PZHPE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0095PZHPE&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20") just because they read its cool.  
They look just like Boba Fett while walking down the street with all of their gear strapped to them.

# 3. Han Solo ( the hunka junker )

<img class='img-responsive' src='/images/posts/han_falcon.jpg'/>

> "What a piece of junk"
> ~ Luke Skywalker

Han Solo will fly the Millennium Falcon to the ground.  
He loves this ship despite its many flaws.  
Although it is a fast ship, it has many issues that Solo and Chewbacca are constantly trying to fix.  
To fly the Falcon properly takes a lot of patience and nuance which only comes with experience.  
Even a skilled pilot like Luke would have trouble.  
Everyone remembers scenes [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-rkFaIPyL4) were even Solo fumbles to get the Falcon to work.

This is analogous to that guy that has the TV remote that needs to be pointed just right, or that old Pentium 4 computer that still works great.  
This guy will never part with his gadgets.  
He is mega attached with them, and will give them an old slap if they need it.

# 4. Anakin Skywalker ( the power user )

> "Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit, and that's what I'm going to do!"
> ~ Anakin

Anakin is savvy with technology from an early age.  
By the end of his life he is still flying around chasing after Rebel Scum, and building the Death Star.  
He is a power user.  

This is your friend who knows all the keyboard shortcuts, and has used computers since he or she could speak.  
This person is always getting annoyed at "NOOBZ" and recommending better ways to do stuff even though no one actually cares.
