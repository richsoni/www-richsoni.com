The beginning of this set is interesting.  blues-in-a-bottle Sound Check is not uncommon.  However, girl-who-laughs-at-the-moon, stormy-window, queen-of-the-carnival.

These performances are all better than usual.  This is certainly due to the focus I gave them at the end of rehearsal.  stormy-window, is slower and more intentional than usual.   

brown-eyed-women is the most intriguing song in my set.  And, it was not used wisely, and I had to tune in the middle of it.  

ordinary-man-and-the-angel was played to the crowd.  It sounds weird listening back now, but it actually was matching in the moment well.  While ordinary-man-and-the-angel did not translate on tape, black-and-blues did.  It’s worth trying it like that again.  

y-control was everything I expected.  A cover with some potential.  nyc felt weird to play.  Maybe I will try it a few more times to see how it goes.

The next set: tomorrow-might-be-monday, workingmans-blues, benny-bet-his-wife-in-a-game-of-texas-stud, song-of-broken-justice is polished.  These songs are my bread and butter at this point.  
I tried waiting-around-to-die a few times before, but I rearranged it during my rehearsals, and its sounding a lot better.

It goes strong until mcalpines-fusiliers which is a weird rendition.

Then I broke a string during Geeshie's Conjecture, and it took a few songs to get it back.
sweet-grass-memory was interesting.

bearfort-tower made its premiere.

By this time my voice is shot, you can it in spookytown.
