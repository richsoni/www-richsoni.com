# Thoughts

This was a notable show with a rough start.
I brought a new piece of equipment with me to this show, my Korg Electribe Sampler.

In the month leading up to this show, I had been meticulously learning the instrument.
With a few basic songs composed, I turned to trying to use the thing with my material.
During rehearsal, I would create a basic beat, and play a few songs to that beat.
I also, set the BPM really slow during rehearsal.
It would average around 50, so I had to perform each song in slow motion.
This was the reason I got the Electribe.
The metronome started to hurt my ears, and I wanted a little more control over the accented beats.

The success during rehearsal did not carry over to live performances though.
I felt very awkward when I tried to use it.
This threw me off my game, until I abandoned it after a few songs.

My guitar had a new set of strings on it, and both E strings kept going out of tune.
While I know the audience probably did not notice, it was really frustrating me because I knew I would hear it in the recordings.
In this distress, I got in the habit of tuning by ear while playing the song.
This was something that I had never done prior to this show.
Another little skill experience gifted to me.

By the time I got to ballad-of-the-condor, these kinks along with the normal sound adjustments seemed to be settled.
I started to slip into the zone, and each song had a nice little pocket.

I was very comfortable, and was experimenting with adjustments to the crowd and the room.
People always notice that I don't take breaks.
This is because I love learning from the performance.
The environment warps the song to its shape.
A song that sounds great in the basement, may sound terrible in a brewery.
After a while, you find yourself compensating for the environment.

Its not just technique, or mixing.
The same song to the same number of people in the same room feels different every single time.
A room changes as customers change.
A womans date goes to the bathroom, and all of a sudden you have someone giving you their undivided attention.
You notice peoples feet tapping to some parts of the song, but not to others.
None of it consciously registering until after the performance.
There is no time, because your mind is fast at work.
Its adapting to these inputs.
This is what I love about performing.

Listening back to the recording, I hear a few interesting things:

During purple-gun, I needed to push harder, so I switched to a c-shape E7 chord instead of the regular E.  This had a neat effect

Most of the active listeners where not clapping because people around them where talking.  This left me without the normal punctuation after a song, so I started went into transition mode
Some of them that I remember:
* the-girl-who-laughs-at-the-moon -> evergreen-eyes
* purple-gun -> lets-get-deserted
* pine-of-the-pub -> black-velvet-band -> wild-rover

I really liked the way the recording of wander-with-me came out.  Its one of my favorites. Lots of potential favorite recordings here.
