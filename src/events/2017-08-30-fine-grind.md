This show at The Fine Grind was good.
I would not say that it was an out of the ordinary show, but it was great fun either way.

You are always growing and learning at each show, and this show was no exception.
I would say the biggest challenge was coming in with a blister.
I have developed blisters while playing a bunch of times, but at this show I started playing with a blister.

While playing, the blister broke, and I actually developed another blister beneath the original one.
That was very painful, and made playing difficult.
I still muscled through it, and played decently well.

Usually I break a string after about an hour.
I think this time I made it an hour and a half, which is great.
The string broke on Two More Things, which I know I strum really heavy on.
I also broke a string during Queen of the Carnival.

This was the second show I tried to do a soundboard recording.
The last one came out really bad because the input was too hot.
This one was much better.
The guitar seems very low though, but I think its the best live recording I have gotten to date.

There is still something charming about an audience recording.
Some day I hope to be able to incorporate both the crowd noise and a solid board input.

After reviewing the recording, I think I played decent enough.
The high points are definitely my new material.
For now, I am still holding back on releasing that material though because I want to record, and file copyright on it.
I don't think it matters much, but its just my own personal preference.

I also tried Instagram Live for the first time at this show.
I think it was a success since some people tuned in.

I was playing pretty strong.
Overall I think this set had the least amount of weak points.
Willie the Wandering Gypsy and Me was definitely the lowest point, and I still muscled through it.
That song is tough to play live.
At home it sounds amazing, but the second I try it out it falls apart.

I started really strong, and kept to my planned setlist for the first 9 songs.
This was also a new thing: starting really strong.
I used to finish my sets with Wander With Me.
Now I am more concerned about keeping the interest, so it makes sense to start strong.

The crowd seemed pretty interested in this show.
You learn a lot when you play at a coffee shop.
If there is a couple on a date, there is a lot of competition for attention.
I was able to hold at least 3 couples attention over the course of a few songs, which I am happy about.

Overall, another great time at The Fine Grind gaining two more hours of performance experience.
