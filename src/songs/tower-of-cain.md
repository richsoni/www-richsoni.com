Some say life is the shadow of our dreams  
Dreams are shadows of the soul  
So, it seems that the dead in the stream  
Are just floating down to get speared by the troll  

*How long must I wait to meet my doom*  
*Listening to the rain*  
*Watching the lightning in the sky*  
*That's life in the Tower of Cain*  

Trust myself, Lord I must trust myself  
I know it must be done  
Got a ladder, took my gun off of the shelf  
Sent a message, saying brother won't you come  

*How long must I wait to meet my doom*  
*Listening to the rain*  
*Watching the lightning in the sky*  
*That's life in the Tower of Cain*  

Some say life is just a brief drop of time  
Pull the trigger as you aim, and smell the spark  
As it cools, all I have left is a sigh  
All alone, like a stone in the dark  

*How long must I wait to meet my doom*  
*Listening to the rain*  
*Watching the lightning in the sky*  
*That's life in the Tower of Cain*
