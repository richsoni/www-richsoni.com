Tweak your mojo bag  
With a rabbits foot  
Rattle snack rattle  
Bat wing soot  

*If your lookin' for salvation*  
*Don't expect it too soon*  
*I've been toiling and waiting*  
*Since the last blood moon*  

Got yourself black book  
Brewed tea, read the leaves  
Flipping tarot cards  
Placing candles at your knees  

*If your lookin' for salvation*  
*Don't expect it too soon*  
*I've been toiling and waiting*  
*Since the last blood moon*  

Prayin' up to Jesus  
Hopin' he'll come  
Fold up all of your fingers  
Twist together your thumbs  

*If your lookin' for salvation*  
*Don't expect it too soon*  
*I've been toiling and waiting*  
*Since the last blood moon*  

You can kill all the evil  
But more always grows  
Burn the forest down
But spare the crows  

*If your lookin' for salvation*  
*Don't expect it too soon*  
*I've been toiling and waiting*  
*Since the last blood moon*
