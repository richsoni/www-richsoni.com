It's a hard road  
It's a hard and dicey road  
That a man must take to be free  

It takes a wild one  
It takes a wild and crazy one  
That wants none but to be free  

*It's a high stakes game that takes no pity*  
*And lord it aint pretty if you loose*  
*You could wise up*  
*You could hush up,*  
*But, if your like me you'll risk the black and blues*  

When you hear dogs  
When you hear dogs barking  
When you see cars parking on your clay  
Will you take root  
Will you tear suits,  
Or will you turn your boots and walk away  

*Its a high stakes game that takes no pity,*  
*And lord it aint pretty if you loose*  
*You could wise up*  
*You could hush up,*  
*But, if your like me you'll risk the black and blues*  

It's a dark road  
Its a dark and lonely road  
That a man must take to be free  

It takes a strong yell  
You have to raise hell  
To scare whats in the shadows in the trees  

*Its a high stakes game that takes no pity,*  
*And, lord it aint pretty if you loose*  
*You could wise up*  
*You could hush up,*  
*But, if your like me you'll risk the black and blues*
