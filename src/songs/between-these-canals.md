I've painted a rainbow on hundreds of doors  
I've malted the barley on the Jameson floor  
I've moved butchered meat from the pigs and the cows  
I've worked every street between these canals  

I've courted a beautiful Trinity lass  
I've lay with her upon the Marion grass  
She broke me heart, shooed me out like a mouse  
I've walked every street between these canals  

I've seen clouds above me turn into dark  
Been in Temple Bar alleys where hound dogs a-bark  
I've lost me belongings, was kicked me house  
I've lurked every street between these canals  

I've lost me body, now I'm a wandering soul  
I've haunted a-many, now I'm just a troll  
I've lived within Christ Church Cathedral's bows  
I've stalked every street between these canals
