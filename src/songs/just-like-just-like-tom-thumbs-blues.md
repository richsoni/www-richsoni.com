When You've Broken Your Spine,  
When Your Coughing Up Brine & Blood Too  
When Your Lost & Confused  
When Groveling Is All You Can Do  

For Years She Shed Tears  
While Her Ears Yearn For The Steps Of My Shoe  
But Once Again,  
The Winds Of Aeolus  
Blew Me Away From You  

Well, If You See Althea,  
Send Her The Wild Roving Sign  
She'll Tell You Your Fortune,  
She'll Sing You Some Four Over Nine  

Then Just Like Calypso,  
She'll Rob You Of Seven Years Time  
And The Last Word She Gives You Is: 'Trouble',  
As She Waves You Goodbye  

Sweet Sabrina, She Liked To Keep It Reckless & Loose  
With Her Roguish Black Eyes, She Would Steal The Aegis Right Off Of Zeus  
The Paupers They Brought Her To The Augur Who Offered Up An Excuse:  
He Points To The Sky, And He Cries, Besides We Already Tied Up The Noose!’  

In Achaea's Yard, A Bard, Sings Your Songs The Clowns  
While They Pilfer Your Wine, They Take Turns Kicking Your Dogs All Around  
Your Fortune's Endangered, You Feel Like A Stranger In Your Own Home Town  
Settled Down In The Rocks, Til' The Locks Of The Dawn Start To Crown  

Here Words On A Wing, For Kings Who's Absence Brings A Different Kind Of Love!  
While Maidens At The Window Sing, 'Bluebeard!  Darling, Won't You Please Come Up!'  
Well, A Sword To Revenge It's Just Like A Net To A Bluff  
I'm Going Back To Anticleia Babe, I Do Believe I've Had Enough
