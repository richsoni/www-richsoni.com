Aint it just like my mind, to play tricks every time  
It thinks it will hear something offending  

Well, I try to exist, but clenched theres a fist  
Holding onto my sanity, sending  

Me into a fog, so search for a log  
In which I can sit, and begin transcending  

This feeling I get, when my palms get all wet  
And the sun in my eyes it starts bending  

To black from white, and then its the night  
And panic begins his great ending  

And......... and then......and then..............  
I'm out cold  


Well,  I think I'm asleep, I don't know theres a heap  
Of strangers bent over me lending  

Their nervous hands, and everything sans  
My sanity is gathered round spending  

All that it can, to help this poor man  
Whose conscious is there but its pending  

And, then I realize that my eyes disguise  
Rainbows are lies my mind is pretending!!!!  

I start to come to, a conclusion or two  
About this circus I am now attending  


I......... I guess......I guess..............  


I was out...cold  


And now every time,  I try to be fine  
But, I feel like my blood is descending  

Down to the ground, and then I am drowned   
With fear while panic's extending  

A shivering finger, to poke madness that lingers  
And my thoughts all begin to start blending  

And all I hear is mush, and I want to to hush  
And my brain it starts recommending  

Some time out of mind, and my teeth start to grind   
I try to breathe, i gnaw at my sleeve  
As my last fighting morsel is fending my tending  


To......... to go......to go..............  

Out cold
