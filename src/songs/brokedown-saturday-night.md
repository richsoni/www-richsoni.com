I'll shoot the lights out
High till its bright out
Whoa, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrife your life?

Stuff I got'll bust your brains out baby
It'll make you loose your mind
Ain't no child, aint no sweet woman kneeling
At the dawn of the Brokedown Saturday Night

Thrice upon a time I was a gabler lord
Twice upon a time I had a bride
Once upon a time I hit the bottom
At a crossroads on a Brokedown Saturday Night

I'll shoot the lights out
High till its bright out
Whoa, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrife your life?
