Three fingers whiskey pleasures the drinkers  
And moving does more than the same thing for me  
Willy he tells me that doers and thinkers  
Say, Movin' is a closest thing to being free  

He rosins his riggins laid back his wages  
He's dead set on ridin' in the big rodeo  
My woman's tired with an overdue baby  
And Willy keeps yelling, Hey Gypsy let's go  

*Willy you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther*  
*Ready rolled from the same makings as me*  
*Well, I reckon we're gonna ramble till Hell freezes over*  
*Willy the wandering Gypsy and me*  

Well ladies we surely will take of your favors  
And we'll surely warn you there never will be  
A single soul living that could put brand or handle  
On Willy the wandering Gypsy and me  

We'll dance on the mountains, shout in the canyons  
Swarm in a loose herd like a wild buffalo  
Jammin' our heads full of figures and angles  
Tellin' us stuff that we already know  

*Willy you're wild as a Blue Texas Norther*  
*Ready rolled from the same makings as me*  
*Well, I reckon we're gonna ramble till Hell freezes over*  
*Willy the wandering Gypsy and me*  

*Yeah, Willy you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther*  
*Ready rolled from the same makings as me*  
*And I reckon we're gonna ramble till Hell freeze us over*  
*Willy the wandering Gypsy and me*
