The summer breeze was blowing all the hair out of my eyes  
Dunking the vice principal, slugging pilfered booze with the guys  

*That's when I saw her standing there*  
*I couldn't be more surprised*  
*She was looking like the queen of the carnival that night*  

I won her heart slugging leapfrogs high into the air  
Even though I never landed her that awful looking pink teddy bear  

*I'm sure it was implied*  
*And, she didn't seem to care*  
*Just entertainment for me and the queen of the carnival that night*  

We gazed into the reflection  
Of the twisted funhouse mirror  
The backdrop was a cover band playing the songs we love to hear  

*On the scrambler my stomach turned with butterflies and fear*  
*With my arm around the queen of the carnival that night*  

I kissed her beneath lights of yellow, blue, and red  
The green grass of the football field was our temporary bed  

*As the fireworks exploded high above our head*  
*I watched them with the queen of the carnival that night*
