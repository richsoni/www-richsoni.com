Enslaved in Killala Bay  
Paddy sheared the sheep and bagged the hay  
But, he was getting kind of board  
Of wailing to the lord  
Until all his bids where cured one rainy day  

The lord fell into Paddys dream  
Said, 'listen man you want to split the scene  
Swing over to the dock  
Just after two o'clock  
Talk with Mr. Smee about our scheme'  

So, he hitched a ride back to Alba isle  
But, found that place was dragging on his style  

*He took a shot of gin, dove in the sea to swim*  
*Cuz saints don't wander far from sin*  
*No saints don't wander far from sin*  

Pastor preaches Jesus said forgive  
That's the way he urges us to live  
Read Luke four and twenty times  
Don't challenge him on lines from Simon, Simon-Peter, Paul, or John  

Miss Moses had a knack for wrong and right  
She never fought remorse late in the night  
She always finds disgust, starts a verbal gust  
Must someone lust less just sustenance in life  

Without those less angelic than they are  
Those left aint quote unquote a star  

*Then they all would look so dim, and none of them would win*  
*So, saints don't wander far from sin*  
*No saints don't wander far from sin*  

See everyone commits a little crime  
Humans misconstrue from time to time  

*Expect to get a grin when they smack you in the shin*  
*Cuz, saints don't wander far from sin*  
*No saints don't wander far from sin*
