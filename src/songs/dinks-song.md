Once I had wings like Noah's dove  
I flew up the river looked for a love  

When I found her, so hard I falled  
My soul it sank, like a cannon ball  

Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well  

One of these days and it won't be long  
Call Ill call her name, and shell be gone  

I remember one night, a drizzling rain  
Round my heart I felt a pain  

Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well  

Once my baby, she loved me so  
Couldn't keep her from my do'  

Boys, now alone at night I lie  
Scarcely ever see her, no matter how hard I try  

Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well  

I lost my heart, to a steel cold gal  
She wanted to ramble, so she shalled  

She took a keepsake, to spark her memory  
And theres a hole, where my heart should be  

Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
