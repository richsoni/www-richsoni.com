Lookie here friend  
Lookie here foe  
Lickie your pen  
Take down some notes  

Take a look at the snow globe  
Take a look right inside  
Take a look at this noble man  
Take a look at pious McBride  

He loves each of his daughters  
He loves each equally  
He loves every man as his brother  
He loves for eternity  

When it comes down to gossip  
He has always abstained  
He finds it way to forgive  
Those that play the neighborhood game  

He should be used as a template  
He should be used as a mold  
Every man would be great  
If they acted like him till their old  

I can see what your sayin'  
I can see it with my eye  
I can also see that you playin' a shallow game  
My eternal wise guy  

Theres a crack in your thesis  
Theres a crack there you see  
Ol' pios McBride has never been  
Stress tested for misery  

If you put him on the treadmill  
If you push him to the edge  
If you push him to double nickels  
I think you'll find that hes no longer your friend  

If you kill all his daughters  
If burn one two three  
He will wish he could slaughter  
You and bury you under that snoozin' tree  

Why do the righteous suffer  
Why do the righteous burn  
Well, whats the difference  
Between them and the damned once you give their crank a turn  

So, my dear listener  
Next time you face pain  
Next time your lost on Easter time  
In Juarez in the rain  

Remember this story  
Remember this song  
Remember which side you want to be right  
And which one to be wrong  

We are given our freedom  
We are given our trust  
But perhaps it wont be us  
Who is judged when we turn into dust  

It could be the ideas  
It could be the speakers above  
Remember that when your choosing to act  
Out of vengeance or out of love  

For we cant see the big picture  
We cant see out of the globe  
We cant see past the seam  
Of the universes starry robe
