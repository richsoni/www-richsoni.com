Don't want no bowl of ice cream baby  
When I need my sugar fix  
All I want is you pretty mama  
to give me a little kiss  
I thought you knew  
I gotta sweet tooth for love  

Stir your finger in my coffee  
Give it a little twist  
Sip it slow, your lipstick strokes  
are left on the side of the lid  
Baby its true  
Gotta sweet tooth for love  

Heading toward the beehive  
Like a honey suckling bear  
Close my eyes and savor  
The sweet fragrance in the air  
How do you do?  
Gotta sweet tooth for love  

Once I knew a woman  
And its true she loved me so  
But her lips they where not sweet  
So I decided to let her go  
What's it to you?  
Gotta sweet tooth for love  

What do you do
Sweet tooth for love
