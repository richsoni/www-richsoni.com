I'd walk a couple hundred miles  
With no shoes, limping all the while  
Trade all my remaining smiles  
To live without you  

I'd forget everything I knew  
I'd push you out of my minds view  
I'd do everything I could do  
To live without you  

*But I don't, Cause I know*  
*That it aint no use*  
*To even try to say goodbye*  
*So, i stay right in your view*  
*Right here, chained up to you*  

I'd stop doing all the things I love  
I'd pray to gods up above  
Give a rattlesnake a shove  
To live without you  

I'd sell off all of my coats  
My book of Oscar Wilde quotes  
Buy me a ticket for a boat  
Destination livin' without you  

*But I don't, Cause I know*  
*That it aint no use*  
*To even try to say goodbye*  
*So, i stay right in your view*  
*Right here, chained up to you*  

I'd erase in all of my songs  
All them catchy singalongs  
Admit that I'm always wrong  
To live without you  

I'd sit up all of the night  
Never seen the sun shining bright  
You couldn't even beat me in a fight  
If the prize was living without you  

*But I don't, Cause I know*  
*That it aint no use*  
*To even try to say goodbye*  
*So, i stay right in your view*  
*Right here, chained up to you*
