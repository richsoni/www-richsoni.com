Baby, lately  
I'm down on the floor  
Hazy, lazy  
and getting bored  

And, I'm tracing ceilings  
Chasing feelings  
Always dreaming about  

*Planes, Trains, autoresponders*  
*Can't take it any longer*  
*Feel it all crashing down*  

*Take me to some foreign city*  
*Exotic voices sound so pretty*  
*When they ask if your from out of town*  

Up creeks  
Green cheeks  
Down on my luck  

No sleep  
Time creeps  
Crawling in muck  

*And, I'm tracing ceilings*  
*Chasing feelings*  
*Always dreaming about*  

*Planes, Trains, autoresponders*  
*Can't take it any longer*  
*Feel it all crashing down*
