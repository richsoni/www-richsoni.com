Evergreen Eyes  
Where to begin?  
In the cold of the night  
They'll warm you like gin  

*And, when I am blue*  
*No cure satisfies*  
*No cure besides*  
*Those Evergreen Eyes*  

Evergreen Eyes  
Where did you go?  
Since you've been gone  
I've been lonesome you know  

*Want nothing to do*  
*With those baby blue skies*  
*I just want to fly*  
*In those Evergreen Eyes*  

Evergreen Eyes  
Now, I tell you the truth  
There aint nothing quite  
As enchanting as you  

*Stay close to me Baby*  
*I can't take more goodbyes*  
*Not from my prize*  
*Those Evergreen Eyes*  
*No, not from my prize*  
*Those Evergreen Eyes*
