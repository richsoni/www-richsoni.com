# chorus
G                             Em
Shes as hot as a three dollar pistol
G                             Em
Her dress it fits like a glove
G                             Em
Its clearer than Waterford Crystal
G              C           D
That She's The Pine Of The Pub

# verse 1

On night with a dog moon in the sky
I welcoming pub caught me eye
Twas a place I aint been before
So, I took off me hat, and I opened the door

The bar was a buzzing and full
I grabbed the last open stool
I asked the barkeep for porter
While I waited looked round shoulder to shoulder

# verse 2

I flag the barkeep back over
Will you do a favor my friend
Send a drink to the fine looking maiden
as I push in me stool once again

I asked her her name and she smiled
her face made a sparkling glance
We talked an laughed for awhile
Then I asked her if shed like to dance

# verse 3

We danced round the room I was on such a high
Buying round after round I let me sovereigns a fly
The night twas one of the best in me life
I was ready to take this fine lass for me wife

The night ends I ask her back to me place
thats when I found me efforts where all just a waste
she said was taken by the barkeep right there
If made more advances i'd better beware
