Are you here upside down  
Well, we're living on the edge of the ocean  
With the mocking rumble ready to drown  
Oh the breeze climbs over my window  
With all the ocean round  
Well then I wakeup every morning  
Brother brother wasn't looking down  
Let me tell you brother it wont be when the seagull cross over town  

S'acrawlin against my window  
I lean my head today  
With all the headings I follow  
Hundred down that gate  
Well, weather will give no warning  
Well open your head to the ground  
Let me tell you brother its coming when the seagulls cross over town
