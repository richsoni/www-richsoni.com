In the silt of Mullica River  
On a dark and stormy eve  
Mother Leeds' haunches quiver  
She sops her sweet with her sleeve  

Though, she's aint a Rook to birthin' babies  
Having twelve within her brood  
Still she called all the local ladies  
To do their dance and set the mood  

*Siren voice is screaming*  
*Cloven tail, hoof, and horn*  
*All the midwives weeping*  
*The Leeds Devils just been born*  

They all gathered in a circle  
Smiled at the newborn in the room  
But then their blood began to curdle  
As his mangled legs grew and grew  

The boy, they all had just been holding  
Now had a goats head and some claws  
His eyes where red and they are bulging  
His wingspan tore up all the gauze  

*Siren voice is screaming*  
*Cloven tail, hoof, and horn*  
*All the midwives weeping*  
*The Leeds Devils just been born*  

Thrashing all about the cabin  
He took his mothers fragile soul  
Through the chimney wings where flapping  
Knocking down the lightning pole  

To this day if you wander  
To far within the piney trees  
Beware of shadows moving yonder  
Pray it aint the likes of Leeds  

*Siren voice is screaming*  
*Cloven tail, hoof, and horn*  
*All the midwives weeping*  
*The Leeds Devils just been born*
