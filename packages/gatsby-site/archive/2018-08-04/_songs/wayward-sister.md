Hard luck don't go down easy  
It seizes up your wits  
But, I promise aint sleazy  
To hack it up to bits  

Those that leave it up to Nature  
To bargain Fortune in their name  
Often justify the torture  
Often revel in the shame  

*Wayward Sister, get up off the floor*  
*Wayward Sister, step out the door*  

Woke up between one and two  
Who are you kidding, you never fell asleep  
In the tips of your fingers you can feel the doom  
Being laughed at by the sheep  

Cooking, cleaning, smiling, scheming,  
Breathing in a chicken room takes a toll  
You've spent years of daydreaming  
Chasing the fox out of its hole  

*Wayward Sister, get up off the floor*  
*Wayward Sister, step out the door*  

Hitched up the hogs about a million times  
Yet what is there to show  
Move to town, drop all your dimes  
Rush down there to earn some more  

We can smell it when you enter  
Don't deny the utter truth  
You've been made over by a blender  
You've been howling to the moon  

*Wayward Sister, get up off the floor*  
*Wayward Sister, step out the door*  

Hard luck don't go down easy  
It suffocates your brain  
But, I promise aint sleazy  
To run away from all the pain  

Nestle with us in the forest  
We eat and sing all of the time  
Live like a transendentalistic tourist  
Is being happy such a crime?  

*Wayward Sister, get up off the floor*  
*Wayward Sister, step out the door*
