I need to write more than one post on this subject.
The audience is behind.
There is too much information being taken for granted here.

I need to write about why recording is important.

1. You improve faster
2. You gain confidence and musicality in your performing
3. You can hear clearly the progress you make over time

I think I can define it better.

Performance is rehearsal for life
Rehearsal is rehearsal for performance
Practice is rehearsal for rehearsal
- Supernatural Rock Star Book

Bob Dylan Studying his performances in 1966
Bob Dylan Recodings available.
Grateful Dead Recordings Available.

Steve Jobs studying like a Rolling Stone

Football Film Nights

Priest quote about making a mistake as a professional

You see clear progress
You fight red light syndrome during rehearsal
You learn to push through mistakes
You evolve

I have a rather large audio collection of my musical performances.
For the past year I have been miserably failing 

Over the years I have become a fanatic about collecting audio recordings of my performances and rehearsals.
I do invest a large amount of effort into this process, and I now have an audio collection of about 50 performances.
Of these, I have only publicly released a small portion.
This is entirely due to the effort required to format these files for public consumption.

When I began recording my performances, the bar was very low.
The process of failing at performance and recording was fruitful enough with lessons that public release was not as critical.

However, as I feel more comfortable with the quality of recording, I see value in having a public archive of these performances.
This includes initial failures.
There are compelling stories and lots of wisdom lurking within those recordings.
As I uncover these things, I find it useful to have the reference material available.
This is but one of many other reasons that I also want my performances on the Live Music Archive.

As the backlog of unreleased grew, and my passion decreased, I realized that

The Live Music Archive is sort of an east meets west between the Deadheads and the .

Almost a year ago, I got myself setup on the Live Music Archive.
This is a service provided by archive.org (the Internet Archive), the nonprofit most remembered for its massive cache of historical web pages (the Wayback Machine).

The ethos' of both the Grateful Dead and The Internet Archive overlap when it comes to the recording and distribution of live music.
The Grateful Dead endorses the taping and free sharing of their live music.
The Internet Archive's mission is "universal access to all knowledge".

I buy into this sentiment, and 

As a means of fulfilling its mission, the Internet Archive has an open section for submission of live music.
Some of the largest live music communities use this archive as the source of truth for their artifacts.
This includes the likes of Grateful Dead, who at the time have 13,724 uploaded artifacts, moe. with 3,680 uploads, Smashing Pumpkins with 1,203, Ween with 695, and Wilco with 675.

The Live Music Archive was launched in 1996, which makes it AOL era technology.


It's age, coupled the support of the Grateful Dead community, pioneers and dominant players in the live music space, particularly recording.

Like many older internet companies, it struggles to be at the forefront of usability, and edginess.
