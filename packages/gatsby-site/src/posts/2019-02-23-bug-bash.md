I noticed a few bugs on my site while poking around recently.
I ignored them at the time, but at this point its started to become noticeable.

Here is the list I came up with:

# Navigation

* **2 line fix**: Navigation Items should be default view (instead of social buttons).  While watching people use my site, I noticed that they have a hard time finding the navigation.  In the future, I will do some research to find a new place to put the social buttons
* **1 line fix**: There is a bug on the social buttons, where they have the default link css (blue color and underline)

# Song Page

* **1 line fix**: Hide `Composed:` if there is no composed_on field (remove `Invalid Date`)
* **10 line fix**: Clean up style on frontmatter for songs

### Song List

* **1 Line Fix**: Header needs more padding
