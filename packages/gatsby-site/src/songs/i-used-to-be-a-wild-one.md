Well, I used to be a wild one
But, I’ve mellowed down with age
Just like Grandpa’s favorite whiskey
Just like Grandma’s beaujolais

Well, I used to be a wild one
Oh my darling yes its true
Well, I used to be a wild one
Till the day that I found you

well I used to be a wild one
born to run, yes i had my fun
But now my heel its got a toothache hun
and I feel like, we’ll like a night right next to you
you know its true

well I used to be a wild one
til the day I finally knew
If you cannot shake the wild one
The wild one shakes the life from you

Well, I used to be a wild one
Oh my darling yes its true
Well, I used to be a wild one
Till the day that I found you
