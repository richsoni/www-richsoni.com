Nuclear bombs blowin' venomous air  
Feel that fallout dust getting stuck in my hair  
Looking for safety, lookin' for a place to survive  
*But, in this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide*  

History books don't tell it so well  
See, this whole damn world is a living hell  
Mountains of people everywhere, knock one and it'll start to slide  
*In this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide*  

Can't go to dinner, cant see a motion film  
Even your commute to work could be the time that you are killed  
You can get shot down while listening to rock music amplified  
*In this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide*  

There's armies forming everywhere, they aint tied to sovereignty  
They just people who hate others living free  
It could be your neighbor, it could be a woman dressed like a bride  
*In this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide*  

Ideas polluting everyone, we all subscribe to some  
Some call to not hurt anyone, others to bang a battle drum  
Each gathering followers, getting stronger than the tide  
*In this whole damn world, there aint a place you can hide*
