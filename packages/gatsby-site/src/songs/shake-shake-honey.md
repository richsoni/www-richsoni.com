Well your, mother knows but she turns her head  
Your father don't, and if he did you'd be dead  
And, now you find yourself crawling out your window  
When its time to go to bed  

*Oh, shake shake honey*  
*Won't you shake on down the ledge*  

You got a driver, and he's got cash to spend  
He says he loves you, but you don't even pretend  
He takes to a disco, and you go lookin' for a friend  

*Shake shake it honey*  
*Looks like hes home alone again*  

A teacher caught you when your where skippin' class  
To head downtown to work your sass  
But, you said he could come with you if he wrote you up a pass  

*Shake shake it honey*  
*Shake it down the grass*  

Well, the people whisper all around the town  
How you wear the moonlight as your evening gown  
But, don't listen to them baby  
They cant prove whats going down  

*Shake shake it honey*  
*Shake it all around*
