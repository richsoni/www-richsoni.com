The undertow underneath our toes  
Will pull us far from the life we know  

All of our dreams  
Happy they seem  
Reality screams so loud  

*Lets get deserted baby*  
*On a desert isle*  
*Maybe then we could be*  
*Alone for a while*  

Coconuts, nipa huts  
Would be all that we need  

The salt in the air  
Flowers in your hair  
Nothing to wear, but a smile  

*Lets get deserted baby*  
*On a desert isle*  
*Maybe then we could be*  
*Alone for a while*  

The salt in the air  
Flowers in your hair  
Nothing to wear, but a smile  

All of our dreams  
happy they seem  
Reality screams so loud  

*Lets get deserted baby*  
*On a desert isle*  
*Maybe then we could be*  
*Alone for a while*
