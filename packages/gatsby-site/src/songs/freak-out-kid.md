I once had a dark revelation  
At a fire in the woods by a creek  
A stranger that I met started shaking  
He rolled back his eyes and started to speak  

The joke is on him he was saying  
He smacked himself in the head  
The posture he had left was decaying  
He contorted and twisted on the forest bed  

We smoked cigarettes as we held him  
We held him down with all of our might  
He was trying to kick his heels past his sternum  
We held him for most of the night  

It was not until several hours later  
His conscious returned to his brain  
We walked him back to his dorm room elevator  
As it opened...  
Once more did it wain  

He whispered in the ear of the closest  
One of us that was standing by him  
As the doors to the elevator closed up  
He flicked us a menacing grin  

I ran into the kid three years later  
At a party 200 miles away  
He we talked and acted as if nothing happened  
Now I pray to the Lord I never see that kid again
