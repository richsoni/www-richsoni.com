Let grasses grow
Let waters flow
In a free and easy way
But, give me enough
Of the rare old stuff
They brewed near galway bay

Come policeman all from Donegal, Kill Devil, and Smithville too
Oh, well give them the slip and we'll take a sip
Of the Rare Auld Mountain Dew

Theres a neat little still
At the foot of the hill
Where the smoke curls far away
You can surely smell
The potent swell
From across the Galway Bay

For it fills the air
with a perfume rare
and betwixt both me and you
as home we troll, we can take a bowl
or a bucket of The Mountain Dew

As learned men, we use the pen
To sing our praises high
Of the rare potion, of Emerald green
Distilled from wheat and rye
Put away your pills, it'll cure all ills
Be ye Uncles and Mothers too
So take off your coat and grease yer throat
With a bucket of The Mountain Dew
