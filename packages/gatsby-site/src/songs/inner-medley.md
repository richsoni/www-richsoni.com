Its just another busy night  
Trying to answer all of the questions in my mind  
It gets so discouraging sometimes  
But, then again that's what makes its worth while to be alive  

*An inner medley*  
*That we hear inside our mind*  
*Yours is yours, and mine is mine*  
*An inner medley*  
*An inner medley*  

It keeps me guessing all the time  
Is there anything wrong with an undescriptive line  
Is doing nothing a such a crime  
Is there anyone who can answer better anytime than  

*An inner medley*  
*That we hear inside our mind*  
*Yours is yours, and mine is mine*  
*An inner medley*  
*An inner medley*
