### Hammer killed John Henry, wont kill me

...is how [Harry Smith] summarizes this song in the [liner notes] to the last section of his [Anthology of American Folk Music].  The following is the original version John Hurt Recorded in 1928.

I however always preferred the version released in 1966:

The song is a rejection of the live by the sword die by the sword mentality portrayed in the traditional John Henry / Gonna Die With A Hammer in My Hand Motif, which [Harry Smith] conveniently included in the same set.
