The hammer that killed John Henry  
But it won't kill me  
No, it won't kill me.  

The hammer that killed John Henry  
But it won't kill me  
No, it won't kill me.  

John Henry was a steel-driving man  
Yes, he went down  
Well, he went down.  

John Henry, he left his hammer  
Layin’side the road  
Layin’side the road.  

John Henry, he left his hammer  
All painted in red  
All painted in red.  

Take this hammer and carry it to my captain  
Tell him I'm gone  
Won't you tell him I'm gone.  

Take this hammer and throw it in the river  
It will ring right on.  
It will shine right on.  

I walked all the way from East Colorado  
Honey, that's my home  
Babe, that's my home  

This is the hammer that killed John Henry  
But it won't kill me  
No, it won't kill me.
