Four and twenty elders  
Deciding the fate of the land  
Four and twenty elders  
Calling every abled man  

Saying 'Drop your things  
Its time to go to war  
The enemy attacked, but attacking what we are not sure'  

Four and twenty women  
Kiss goodbye their one true love  
four and twenty women  
Clasp their hands up above  

Saying 'Angels bring  
my man home safely from war  
the elders have called, but for what we are not sure'  

Four and twenty young men  
With a swords in their hand  
Four and twenty young men  
March to fight as a band  

Saying 'Let me sting  
The enemy in this war  
Better them than me, then again I can't be sure'  

Four and twenty elders  
Too young to fight their own battle  
Four and twenty elders  
Cast others to the saddle  

When they die and get wings  
God wont forget this war  
He will know blood was shed, but the reason he will not be sure
