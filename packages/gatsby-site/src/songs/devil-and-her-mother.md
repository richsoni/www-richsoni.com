The Devil and her mother  
Rained it down on me  
When I mentioned that her lover  
Was seen kissing Nelly B.  

The Devil and her mother  
They raced across the room  
Pushed aside poor Nelly  
And sent Johnny to his tomb  

*Mama this man,*  
*He's been doin' me wrong*  

The Devil and her mother  
They never tell no jokes  
And, if you tell one to them  
Your get your ankles broked  

The Devil and her mother  
They like to tell their lies  
But, if you tell em yours  
They'll scratch you in the eyes  

*Mama this man,*  
*He's been doin' me wrong*  

The Devil's icy father  
Came rising from the sea  
Saying whats become of Johnny?  
He's been with Nelly B.  

*Papa this man,*  
*He's been doin' me wrong*  

The Devil and her mother  
To pay for what they've done  
Where banished past the river  
To the land without a sun  

If you ride that river  
On an evening just like this  
You can her the Devil whisper  
Mama, look who it is  

*Mama that man,*  
*He's been doin' me wrong*
