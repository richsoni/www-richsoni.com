Your ear will hear a dreary sound  
When you boots have found  
The path to Spookytown  

There aint no corpses lying in the ground  
They all walk around  
The streets of Spookytown  

All the Hell hounds, chewin' on a crown  
See, there aint no pound  
In Spookytown  

All the trains are Transylvania bound  
When they zoom out  
Of Spookytown  

A black widow's webbing wound  
The brides wedding gown  
In Spookytown  

From a tomb the groom  
Dug up the rings of Egyptian kings  
Bling  

The ceremony lead with a frown  
By a bloody hobo clown  
In Spookytown  

If you wander in just turn around  
You wont be down  
With Spookytown
