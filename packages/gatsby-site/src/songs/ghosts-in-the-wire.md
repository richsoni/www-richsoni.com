Well there's ghosts in the wire, ma  
Listening when I speak  
Oh, there's ghosts in the wire, ma  
Listening when I speak  
It feels like a snitch  
A coward or a freak  

There's a sound neath my bed, ma  
I feel like I cant get down  
There's a sound neath my bed, ma  
I feel like I cant get down  
Get this monster out of my room  
I don't want him around  

Well there's eyes in my window, ma  
Watching while I sleep  
Oh, there's eyes in the window, ma  
Watching while I sleep  
Well it might be Osiris   
Judging all my sheep  

There's a ghoul in the closet, ma  
Looking to find some bones  
Oh, there's a ghoul in the closet, ma  
Trying to score some bones  
Well, I aint got no bones  
But, if I did I'd want them left alone  

My curtains are shakin', ma  
And, tonight there aint no wind  
My curtains are shakin', ma  
And, tonight there's not single gust of wind  
I think its a vampire  
Tryin' to get me pinned  

There's a witch in the tree, ma  
Laughing when I cry  
Oh there's a witch in the tree, ma  
She laughs every time that I cry  
When I ask her what's funny,  
Don't be shy is hear reply
