Hey baby doll, how you livin'  
Workin' here in the mall sellin' care for skin?  
Its just funny our last conversation  
You said you could design fashion in Berlin  

Howdy Jack, tell me what's good  
Ten years ago you always could  
Now your a carpenter gluing wood  
You wife left you for some man in a hood  

*Some people are just a fad*  
*Had, by they leave there mom and their dad*  
*And, who would have thought that the want ad*  
*Was lookin' for stripes but but you only bought plaid*  

Hows it shakin' duchess, (peck on cheek)  
Its been a minute since I heard you squeak  
Who woulda though she hit her peak  
26 and neglects her physique  

Hey buddy, put er there  
Hows Americas favorite teddy bear  
Where is your beard you look like a square  
Looks like the man caught you in his snare  

*Some people are just a fad*  
*Had, by they leave there mom and their dad*  
*And, who would have thought that the want ad*  
*Was lookin' for stripes but but you only bought plaid*  

The only thing I say bought myself  
Is brother I value of health and wealth  
I know my thoughts change with the seasons  
But I still move forward to find my meaning  

And know to answer only to me  
Requires dottin' my i's and crossin' my tees  
Gotta pedal your own bike without skiddin' your knees  
To walk down the highway as a man that's free  

*Some people are just a fad*  
*Had, by they leave there mom and their dad*  
*And, who would have thought that the want ad*  
*Was lookin' for stripes but but you only bought plaid*
