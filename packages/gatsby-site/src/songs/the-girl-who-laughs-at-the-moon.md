They say to stay away  
From the house by the mouth of the walnut lagoon  
All of the town gossip about  
The girl when laughs at the moon  

Sister June is drunk in her room  
In The Governor Seat is a leech  
Wearing buffalo skin  
The farmer skipped town  
But his kids float around  
And Alas,  
The girl who laughs at the moon  

When the light hides  
The stars in the sky  
Its easy to loose yourself in a dream you think is true  
So when its burning out  
You either lower your snout  
Or you lookup, and you laugh at the moon  

On a warm eve  
I start to believe  
This Old World  
Aint gonna twirl to the beat of yer tune  
So, I chastise the town  
And they call me a clown  
Like the girl who laughs at the moon
