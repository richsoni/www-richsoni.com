If I had to ask you where the rain starts  
You'd say where a drop falls onto you  
You act like the line starts just at your back love  
There aint line on the corner of 8th avenue  

*I hate to break it to you babe*  
*It's hard to explain this*  
*Your just one in a million*  
*And, one in million aint hard to miss*  

Is it true that you think that in the evening  
Everyone goes to sleep because you do  
You think they think the world would be boring  
Unless your awake too  

I bet that fortune five hundred corporation  
Really can feel it when you are gone  
There all sitting around counting seconds  
Waiting for you to finish listening to this song  

*I hate to break it to you babe*  
*Its hard to explain this*  
*Your just one in a million*  
*And, one in million aint hard to miss*  

You missed it when you where too busy for the last party  
There was a couple just curious about what you eat  
They wish you would snap them a picture  
And, send it to them so there mind could just be at ease  

Even your mother, she was saying your stories  
All sounded just like an old friend of hers  
In fact now that she really thinks about it  
You've nothing which which even in small talk deserves  

*I hate to break it to you babe*  
*It's hard to explain this*  
*Your just one in a million*  
*And, one in million aint hard to miss*  

Despite what you think about Mona Lisa  
She's lookin' at me no less than she is you  
There's a funny thing you should know about Lisa  
Eh, nevermind you'll just tell me it aint true  

*I hate to break it to you babe*  
*It's hard to explain this*  
*Your just one in a million*  
*And, one in million aint hard to miss*
