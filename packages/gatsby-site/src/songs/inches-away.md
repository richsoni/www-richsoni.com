My dreams came true the day that I met you  
Nothing ever seemed so sure to me  
I knew our love could grow if we let it  
Grow to be stronger than the raging sea  

*Time moves quick*  
*Work seems like play*  
*When the girl of your dreams sleeps just inches away*  

It's safe to say, my darlin' you complete me  
You make the sun shine bright when I am low and down and blue  
I love to hold you tightly into the evening  
And feel your warmth as the dawn comes into view  

*Time moves quick*  
*Work seems like play*  
*When the girl of your dreams sleeps just inches away*  

My dreams came true the day I met my darlin'  
Nothing ever seemed so sure to me  
I knew our love could fly higher than a starling  
Soaring over the wispy mountaintops of Tennessee  

*Time moves quick*  
*Work seems like play*  
*When the girl of your dreams sleeps just inches away*
