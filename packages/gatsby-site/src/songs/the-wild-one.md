Well, I used to be a wild one  
But, I’ve mellowed down with age  
Just like Grandpa’s favorite whiskey  
Just like Grandma’s Beaujolais  

Well, I used to be a wild one  
Oh my darling yes its true  
Well, I used to be a wild one  
Till the day that I found you  

Well, I used to be a wild one  
Born to run, yes i had my fun  
But now my heel its got a toothache hun  
And I feel like, a simple night right next to you  
You know its true  

Well, I used to be a wild one  
Til' the day I finally knew  
If you cannot shake The Wild One  
The Wild One shakes the life from you  

Well, I used to be a wild one  
Oh my darling yes its true  
Well, I used to be a wild one  
Till the day that I found you
