Sarah Ruth, you snap those beans I'll snap yo bone  
Sarah Ruth, man I'd be better off alone  
I smell like Bourbon, well you smell like sermon  
Sarah Ruth  

Sarah Ruth, I was broken down the highway  
Sarah Ruth, next thing you know we gettin' married  
Hates my tattoos, aint that what you are  
Sarah Ruth  

Sarah Ruth, I was on the field on morning  
Sarah Ruth, I crashed my tractor without warning  
You where on my mind, I coulda went blind  
Sarah Ruth  

Sarah Ruth, I didn't realize I was already blind  
Sarah Ruth, now I left all my mistakes behind  
I found the Lord, the one you adore  
Sarah Ruth  

Sarah Ruth, don't you see I did this for you  
Sarah Ruth, I proudly wear this big tattoo  
You think its profane, you think lewd  
Sarah Ruth  

Sarah Ruth, now I sit outside our home  
Sarah Ruth, with a bloody face cold as a stone  
Beat me with a broom and sent me on  
Sarah Ruth
