Fools bolt like hermit crabs  
From the raging flood in taxi cabs  
But, darlin' there aint nothin' you can grab  
To stab down the need for love  

Carpetbaggers, gypsy kings  
Silver tongued mermaids sing  
Conned the goldsmiths wives out of her rings  
To play on their need for love  

*You could name, any price*  
*Babe, and they'd pay it twice*  
*Just to get em' a slice*  
*Cuz' we all need it, we all need it*  

Swift foot of time walking slow  
At the speed of two people who know  
There aint no more steps in which they must go  
To fulfill their need for love  

Romeo, Paris, Mr. McBride  
All feeding the fish on the countryside  
You aint alive until you have cried for someone that died  
In the name of their need for love  

*You could name, any price*  
*Babe, and they'd pay it twice*  
*Just to get em' a slice*  
*Cuz' we all need it, we all need it*
