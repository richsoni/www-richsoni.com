Bent my hat  
Lost my keys  
Fuss with my woman  
Dogs got fleas  
Wading in water straight passed my knees  
*That's the way it goes sometimes*  
*Walk and wheeze*  

Walking high  
Walking low  
Walking cuz I got no place to go  
Don't have a second to feel the breeze  
*That's the way it goes sometimes*  
*Walk and wheeze*  

Pressures down  
Boss is gone  
Found some babka he can...drizzle on  
Still I work till I got swollen knees  
*That's the way it goes sometimes*  
*Walk and wheeze*  

Passed a bottle  
Passed a stone  
Passed a woman sitting all alone  
Passed a chance to sail the seven seas  
*That's the way it goes sometimes*  
*Walk and wheeze*
