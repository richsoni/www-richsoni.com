When your clock it stops a-tickin''  
And its time for you to go  
When your clock it stops a-tickin'  
Brother I want you to know  

If a crow is at your window  
I'll be sittin' by your bed  
Forget that crow upon your window  
Focus on my singing instead  

Don't you worry about nobody  
I'll keep everything in control  
While there tending to your body  
I'll tend to your soul  

When your days are getting numbered  
When your weary to your toe  
When your days are getting numbered  
Brother I want you to know  

Depart with a tranquil feeling  
Live this moment as you wish  
Depart with a tranquil feeling  
Before you flip off that switch  

I'll make sure the angels get it  
To induct you to their shoal  
Brother don't you fret it  
I'll tend to your soul  

I'll bring it every where with me  
Making sure its never lost  
I'll bring it every where with me  
Until its time to hand it off  

I'll keep it right next to mine  
I'm sure there's space in there for both  
They'll both be there intertwined  
Yeah, I'll tend to your soul
