The Bearfort Tower 1932  
Jack he cut down his ol’ buddy Blue  
Four Winds howl by the lady red  
she plays her music in the sheriffs bed  

Roll away  
My old buddy won’t you keep on rollin’  
Roll away  
My old buddy won’t you keep on rollin’ on  

Who’s the man who burnt Bearfort down?  
The Four Winds whisper all across the town  
Wildwood flowers in the sheriffs pale  
Red eye bottle on his pile of mail  

{chorus}

Hickory Fire, red ivory scent  
The four winds cool on the clay cement  
Wildwood flower floating in the still  
From Bearfort Tower Sheriff whistles squeal  

{chorus}

From Franklin Mine to the The Bearfort Tower  
The four winds carry a wildwood flower  
Wildfire blazes from the mountain ridge  
You can smell the burning from the Milford Bridge  

{chorus}

Wildwood Flowers grow from a broken bone  
Jack he’s free to roam alone  
Four Winds stale in hollow log  
Ol’ Bearfort Tower, is forever gone  

{chorus}
