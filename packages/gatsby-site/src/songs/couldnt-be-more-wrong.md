Early in the morning  
While the captain's snoring  
Grab my hat  
and, start exploring  

Sipping on a tea  
Sip it by the sea  
I have to go, wait another 3  

It aint a crime, I'm just another dime  
To the nursery rhyme  
Of Mr your not on time  

As he licks his lips  
Gives his cuffs a twist  
But, i wont let him slap my wrist  

Hes a cactus thorn  
If my pants are torn  
But, all his scorn  
Is just a joke to me  

I'm just blowing rings  
Hes typing things  
Never knew the spring  
was even coming  

I'll be marching on  
Before the sun is gone  
He thinks its wrong  
I think its funny
