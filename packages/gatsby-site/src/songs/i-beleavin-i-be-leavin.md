I believin', I be leavin' in the morning  
I believin', I be leavin' you behind  
I be leavin', cuz I believin' you been exploring  
I be leavin', cuz I believin' you thinks I'm blind  

I believin', I be leavin' cuz I feel so doggone lonesome  
I believin', I be leavin' you alone  
I be leavin', cuz I believin' you vows a broken  
I be leavin', and I be leavin' to go and roam  

*Sometimes life it gives you lemons*  
*That you can squeeze in someones eye*  
*So go ahead attack my with your venom*  
*I'll have to go ahead and try*  

I believin', I be leavin' my darlin'  
I believin', I be leavin' her seemin' blue  
I be leavin', cuz I believin' you just charming  
To find another man without a clue
