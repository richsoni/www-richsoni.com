I was riding on the ghost line  
Strumming a lonesome chord  
Never had so much time  
Yet never been so bored  

I took my guitar, and painted its pick guard blue  
*Honey, I was jumping freight trains until I found you*  

I traveled through the backwoods  
Slept beneath the stars  
Felt so lonesome as I stood  
Alone in the engine yard  

I was looking for an answer, but I didn't have a single clue  
*Honey, I was jumping freight trains until I found you*  

I've been up all night with gamblers  
Lost to aces backed with 8's  
Shuffling all my colors  
But, couldn't get them straight  

I went face up with a pair of when I should have just withdrew  
*Honey, I was jumping freight trains until I found you*  

On the rocky road to Dublin  
I worked only to eat  
I couldn't find a place  
Where I could rest my feet  

Blurring my mind with good old mountain dew  
*Honey, I was jumping freight trains until I found you*  

I was a lackey on a sailboat  
To a curly mustached pirate fixed on crime  
He was slitting innocent throats  
I was hauling the bow line  

I was just a member of a marooned and dirty crew  
*Honey, I was jumping freight trains until I met you*  

I was shacking in Gomorrah  
Watching the filth slither by  
Washing feet for some Poobah  
While he made his daughters cry  

I just made out when the brimstone began to accrue  
*Honey, I was jumping freight trains before I met you*  

Every time id find a road  
It would lead me astray  
Banging on a rusty compass  
Trusting it to guide my way  

Now its found a north that's true  
*Honey, I was jumping freight trains before I met you*
