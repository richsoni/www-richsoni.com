Don't cry, Don't cry  
Wipe away your tears cuz its a real good year to be alive  

Its alright, Its alright  
You'll wake up in the morning and forget all about tonight  

*She does this every time and we don't really want to hear her whine*  
*She comes, she drinks, she laughs, she cries, she calls a cab, and says goodnight*  
*And we don't want her to ruin our night*  

Alright, Alright  
You'll wake up in the morning and forget all about tonight  

*You do this every time and we don't really want to hear you whine*  
*You come you drink you laugh you cry you call a cab and say goodnight*  
*And we don't want you to ruin our night*
