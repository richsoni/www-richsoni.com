Did you smell the roses in the air?  
Did you smell the roses in the air?  

*With my feet above the square*  
*I couldn't even bear*  
*The smell of all the roses in the air*  

Did you see it written in the stone?  
Did you see it written in the stone?  

*Yes, I stood there all alone*  
*Till after grass had grown*  
*All the while staring at the stone*  

Can't you hear the singing in the wind?  
Can't you hear the singing in the wind?  

*Yes, each night I do spend*  
*Hearing songs that never end*  
*Coming in my window with the wind*  

Is it still against you to believe?  
Is it still against you to believe?  

*I'd be lying through my teeth*  
*From my skin to deep beneath*  
*If I promised to you that I do believe*
