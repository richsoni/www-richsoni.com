# Participants
* Carolina was the only participant.  I grab her info to share with anyone who wants to look her up :(

# Thoughts

This was a light open mic night, so I got to rehearse a bit of my material.
I did not get a recording because I forgot the wire I needed.

Practiced just-like-tom-thumbs-blues for the first time live.
It was rocky.
