title: Templating Your Booking Inquiry Emails
author: Rich Soni

This was written for the Bandflare Blog.
See it the original [here](http://blog.bandflare.com/diy/template/venue/management/2016/10/12/templating-booking-request-emails.html)

DIY musicians need to send booking inquiries on a regular basis.
Putting the time and consideration into a well crafted, reusable template saves time and ensures quality.

I have a few of these templates differ in wording slightly based on venue style and location.

Here is the one I use most often:

```
SUBJECT: Booking Inquiry: Rich Soni
BODY:
Hi VENUE_NAME_HERE,

My name is Rich Soni, and I am a local singer/songwriter.
I am exploring new places to play, and love to book a date at your venue.
I believe my experience playing at SIMILAR_VENUES_HERE make me well suited to perform at your establishment.

I usually have about 20 fans show up to each of my shows, and my sets contain a mix of original music, Irish Songs, and Acoustic Covers (Bob Dylan, Grateful Dead, The Band etc.)

You can find out more about me including sample me music here: bandf.la/re1e95b.

Hope to hear from you soon,
Rich
```

# Crafting Your Own

There are some things that may differ in your template.
Here are some variations I encounter.

## Personal Description

I alter the `local singer/songwriter part` based upon the performance type, and location.
Sometimes I put `local musician` other times I put `touring singer/songwriter` or `singer/songwriter from New Jersey`.

## Venue Name vs. Booker Name

Usually I do not know the name of the person booking the shows.
If I do the email changes slightly.

Obviously, I address them by name in the salutation.
I also change the sentence: `book a date at your venue` to `book a date at VENUE_NAME` since booking is often done by a promoter who handles several venues.

## Bandflare Relay

In the past I had a section that looked like this:

```

Here are some links:
* Facebook
* Website
* iTunes
* Spotify
* Bandcamp
```

But now, I use [Bandflare Relay links](relay.bandflare.com).
This was their original use case, but they have proved to be useful for lots more.
