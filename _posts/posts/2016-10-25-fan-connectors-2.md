In a [previous post](/posts/2016-10-07-fan-connectors.html), I found two questions about music discovery which I wanted to explore.
I conducted a survey both online and in person soliciting the following questions:

1. What was the last song you discovered?
1. How did you discover it?

There where 30 people surveyed so far.
The results are posted below:

A few interesting points:
1. I found one maven who found rap mixtapes with a special app for leaking mixtapes
1. The lions share of discovery is via youtube and friends

This is a crude survey because for several reasons:
1. Discovery is most likely sector specific (age, genre, location, etc.), and I got mostly college students to respond
1. Its only 30 people

However, it gives me a string to start pulling.

Here is the next set I am curious about:
1. How are people discovering music on Youtube?
1. What where the people doing with their friends when they discovered the new music?
