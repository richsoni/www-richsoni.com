# Guess Who's Back?

It's been a few months since the last [richsoni.com](https://richsoni.com) update.

I poured my attention into a passion project: [gifficult.com](https://gifficult.com).
The site is a new way to visualize Reddit, [*Try It Out*](https://gifficult.com).

[Gifficult](https://gifficult.com) has stabalized as a project.
As such, I have energy to focus back on RichSoni.
