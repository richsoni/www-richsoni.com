title: What Are The Fan Connectors?
---

For a while I have been playing out at restaurants and breweries.
These shows are great because the venue will pay you, and there is no tickets to sell to your fans.
The problem I noticed is I do not acquire many new fans in these situations.

This carried my thoughts to an idea presented by Malcolm Gladwell in his book: The Tipping Point.
I have a hunch that people are too saturated with new great music these days, and they rely on filters to receive it.
Gladwell calls these entities Connectors.

Who and What are the connectors are unknown to me.
I only know my own outlets.
This is a great hypothesis to test.
I would like to survey potential fans about where they find music.

Here is the survey I would like to conduct:

Name the last musical artist I have a hunch that people are too saturated with new great music these days, and they rely on filters to receive it.
Gladwell calls these entities Connectors.

Who and What are the connectors are unknown to me.
I only know my own outlets.

I am going to conduct the following survey:
* What is the last song you remember falling in love with (to the best of your knowledge):
* Where did you first hear that song (to the best of your knowledge):

Hopefully this will shed some light into where people discover music.
