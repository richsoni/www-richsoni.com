# Takeaways

All vimmers should know three names: Tim Pope, Learn Vim The Hard Way Guy, and Drew Neil.  

Tim Pope writes the best vim plugins hands down.  

Drew Neil runs the vimcasts website.  

Practical Vim is a treasure trove of vim tips.  
Any vimmer will take a ton of stuff out of this book.  
If you have used vimcasts before, understand that this book is not the same.  


...It is 1,000x better.  


I really like vimcasts, but Practical Vim knocks it out of the park.  
I read this book in 4 days while on vacation.  I could not put it down.  Then when I got back I skimmed it again.  
That is how awesome this book is.
