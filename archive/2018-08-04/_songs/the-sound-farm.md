It's a long hard day  
When your steeped in the clay  
On The Sound Farm  

The steam whistle blow  
Is the red roosters crow  
On The Sound Farm  

*Well the pay aint great*  
*And, they make you stay late*  
*On The Sound Farm*  

*A true friend is rare*  
*Cuz, most will scalp your hair*  
*On The Sound Farm*  

Well, you work in the sleet  
And, you work in the heat  
On The Sound Farm  

The Planters two sons  
Have first claim on all the fun  
On The Sound Farm  

*It makes no sense to run*  
*From the blistering sun*  
*On The Sound Farm*  

*Cuz' there aint a single place*  
*To hide your scalding face*  
*On The Sound Farm*  

When you think that you're done  
You have only just begun  
On The Sound Farm  

You look toward the fire  
Cuz' you can't ever retire
From The Sound Farm  

*But, even then*  
*It's only just began*  
*On The Sound Farm*  

*Cuz' even from the grave*  
*They'll be calling on your name*  
*On The Sound Farm*
