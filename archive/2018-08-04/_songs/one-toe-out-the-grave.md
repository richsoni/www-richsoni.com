Hard aint nothin'' mama  
When you done what I done  
See I sold my heart, just to keep my gun  

Hard aint nothin' sister  
When you've seen what I've seen  
I've seen myself corrupt poor people in this world that  
Used to call themselves clean  

*Don't go thinkin' there aint nothin'*  
*There aint nothin' left to save*  
*Cause I've still got at least one*  
*Wigglin' toe out of the grave*  

Hard aint nothin' brother  
When you heard what I heard  
Midnight banshee cryin' terror  
Cause of some trouble that I stirred  

This place could blow at any second  
And there aint no second chance  
No matter what you do or try, its sorta out of all our hands  

*Don't go thinkin' there aint nothin'*  
*There aint nothin' left to save*  
*Cause I've still got at least one*  
*Wigglin' toe out of the grave*  

Hard aint nothin' mama  
Hard aint nothin' sister  
Hard aint nothin' brother  
Hard aint nothin' no more  

*Dont' go thinkin' there aint nothin'*  
*There aint nothin' left to save*  
*Cause I've still got at least one*  
*Wigglin' toe out of the grave*
