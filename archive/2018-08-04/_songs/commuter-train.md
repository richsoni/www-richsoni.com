Well the hiss of the rail always begins the tail  
As the people gather all around  
Some late legs flail as the whistle wails  
When the commuter train rolls into town  

A gust will push back a wave of whoosh  
As the brakes rush to stop wheels from spinnin'  
The business men fight to see who can  
Guess precisely where the door will land to open  

The conductors shout the destinations out  
As they herd the people in the doorway  
They all shove and beat toward the last remaining seats  
When the commuter train rolls into town  

As some sit down they refuse too look around  
As they isolate themselves to their own devices  
Others sit back and munch on a snack  
And they wonder why were all so lifeless  

With the passengers inside the train speeds on its guide  
The rugged rails that never complain  
About the hot or the cold or carrying the load  
That buzz inside the commuter train  

They twist all around the woods and the towns  
Under tunnels where artists paint graffiti  
They hiss tell all the adolescent clowns  
To place penny that it will squish so easy  

At its final stop it drops the commuters off  
Where they rush out the door just like they came in  
The rails opine how they deliver them on time  
When ever the commuter train rolls in  

The train bumps back saying 'yo rails aint part of that  
You all are just tools in the system'  
They agree to disagree but understand mutually  
Each one enjoys their simple mission
