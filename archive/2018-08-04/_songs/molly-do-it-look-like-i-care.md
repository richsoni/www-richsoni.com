title: Molly Do It Look Like I Care

I aint the guy who rides inside of Noah's ark
but, I aint the guy who cries we must beware
well God was lookin' at me
when he raised up the deep blue sea
but, Molly do it look like I care?

It was said I'd be dead and gone
by the time big red gets to hear this song
lets us pray that the scriptures wrong
in this very specific case

I was riding on my unicorn
when buckets of rain started pouring
while in the sky a dove was soaring
saying soon youll know your place

I aint the guy who rides inside of Noah's ark
but, I aint the guy who cries we must beware
well God was lookin' at me
when he raised up the deep blue sea
but, Molly do it look like I care?

I knew I had no time to loose
so I left behind my running shoes
