I'm just a man  
An ordinary man  
Made out of muscle and blood  

She was a girl  
An angel of a girl  
That came from the stars above  

*I took her dancing by a river that I know*  
*We were dancing neath her native moonlight glow*  
*Cuz when an ordinary man finds himself an angel*  
*He'd be a fool to let her go*  

I mined me a stone  
No ordinary stone  
The rarest stone in the land  

Set it in a ring  
A golden ring  
And placed it into her right hand  

*I took her dancing by a river that I know*  
*We were dancing neath her naitive moonlight glow*  
*Cuz when an ordinary man finds himself an angel*  
*he'd be a fool to let her go*  

I'm just a man  
An ordinary man  
Made out of water and mud  

She was a girl  
An angel of a girl  
That came from the stars above  

*I took her dancing by a river that I know*  
*We were dancing neath her naitive moonlight glow*  
*Cuz when an ordinary man finds himself an angel*  
*he'd be a fool to let her go*
