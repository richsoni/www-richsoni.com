Some people born, to workin' every day  
Others are there to take the workers pain away  
They could tell a good joke, or sing a good song  
Its hard to say if ones is right or ones wrong  

*Some people want to make you give, give, give*  
*But not me, babe*  
*Babe, I was born to live*  

Some where born, to never leave the city  
At the foot of buildings touching the sky  
Other ones, live a life so gritty  
They never wore a suit or tie  

*Some people want to make you give, give, give*  
*But not me,*  
*Babe, I was born to live*  

I aint lookin' to yak yak yak  
Fear the future and regret the past  

I'll eat when I'm hungry and sleep where I lay  
I'll do what I want and live till I die  

*Some people want to make you give, give, give*  
*But not me,*  
*Babe, I was born to live*  

*Some people want to make you give, give, give*  
*But not me,*  
*Babe, I was born to live*
