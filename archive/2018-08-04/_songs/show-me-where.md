I gave my loving  
I gave it to you  
I thought us two where stuck like glue  
But, then you packed your things and said so long  

*Baby, won't you show me where I went wrong*  

Buying roses by the bouquet  
A box of chocolates on valentines day  
In the card, I wrote you a song  

*Baby, won't you show me where I went wrong*  

I took you swimming in South Caroline  
You drank your mojito your drank your wine  
We sat on the beach all day long  

*Baby, won't you show me where I went wrong*  

I built a fire  
We lay on the rug  
I gave my kiss  
I gave my hug  
The heat it was oh so strong  

*Baby, won't you show me where I went wrong*
