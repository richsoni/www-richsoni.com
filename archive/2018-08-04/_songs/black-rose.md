Well, the first time I saw her was down in New Orleans  
Steeping a cure-all of honey and Jimson weed  
Sewed a mojo hand in the seam of my jean  
Did a little dance like a voodoo queen  

*Oh Black Rose*  
*Never near, but always close*  
*Face to face when the moonlight glows*  
*Feel the dawn, as her silhouette goes*  
*Oh Black Rose*  

Saw her gathering feathers outside of Stovepipe Wells  
Wearing some leather plated with terrapin shells  
Pricked my hand pulled me under her spell  
In the cool of the sand where the spirits yell  

*Oh Black Rose*  
*Never near, but always close*  
*Face to face when the moonlight glows*  
*Feel the dawn, as her silhouette goes*  
*Oh Black Rose*  

The last time I saw her was in the Lake Eerie fog  
Eyes in the water I thought she was just a mirage  
Sitting low in the wake of the bog  
Emerging slow floating like a god  

*Oh Black Rose*  
*Never near, but always close*  
*Face to face when the moonlight glows*  
*Feel the dawn, as her silhouette goes*  
*Oh Black Rose*
