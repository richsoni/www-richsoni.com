Don't you ever question the threats I make to you  
Released from my possession you'll  be more than black and blue  
If you touch my woman, if you even pinch her knee  
Remember you will have to answer to me  

There will be no mercy  
There will be no mercy  

If you mess with her ill hang you out to dry  
Ill drop your squirming body from the Cliffs Of Mohr so high  
Ill kick you off the side rail, and send you to your tomb  
And leave your soul to dusty who will haunt you with her gloom  

There will be no mercy  
There will be no mercy  

In general, I'm pretty mellow guy  
But if you touch my woman  
Ill make your mother cry  
Shell be calling for her baby, but she wont get no reply  
Shell never see you again no matter how hard she tries  


There will be no mercy  
There will be no mercy
