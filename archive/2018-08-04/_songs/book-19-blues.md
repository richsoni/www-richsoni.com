bible tells us of a man, who rides from heaven unto the land
his eyes of flames, his eyes of fire, eyes that can judge your deepest desire

bible tells us of a chief, who comes with a sword clenched between his teeth
his name not a single mortal man knew, his name it is faithful and true

bible tells us of force, sat upon an ashen horse
leading a ghastly calvary, clothed in fine linen white and clean

bible tells us of a man, who wages battle with an open hand
against the worldly captains and kings, against the free and those tied to a string
