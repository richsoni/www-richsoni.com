Seven days, is way too long  
I cant see your face, and baby thats so so wrong  
I love you dear, wish you where here  

Another week of goodbyes, more tears in our eyes  
Another week of sighs, on the lonely nights  
But I love you dear, wish you where here  

If I could run back home, find you in your room alone  
Pull you up into my arms keep you from the worlds harm  
Look you in the eyes and say  

*Oh its over now*  
*What goes up always comes down*  
*Even when, even when, even when its not the best*  
*I say amen, I say amen because the both of us are blessed*  

Another fight, baby thats not right  
We went off like a kite, I could make it alright if I said  
I love you dear, and thats sincere  

Now your walking away, and thats not ok  
I really want you to stay  
But its too late to say  
I love you dear, just stay here  

If I could run back home, find you in your room alone  
Pull you up into my arms keep you from the worlds harm  
Look you in the eyes and say  

*Oh its over now*  
*What goes up always comes down*  
*Even when, even when, even when its not the best*  
*I say amen, I say amen because the both of us are blessed*  

Turn that frown upside down  
Make a sad song a happy sound  
Sometimes love comes around  
Lets turn this thing back around  
Sometimes even the best have a break down  

*Oh its over now*  
*What goes up always comes down*  
*Even when, even when, even when its not the best*  
*I say amen I say amen because the both of us are blessed*  

*Oh its over now*  
*What goes up always comes down*  
*Even when, even when, even when its not the best*  
*I say amen I say amen because the both of us are blessed*
