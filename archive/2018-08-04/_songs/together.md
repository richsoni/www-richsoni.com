Oh my baby, I love her so  
We go down, to the Jersey Shore  
Well get coffee, in the morning and bagels too  
Be on the parkway by 11, be on the beach by noon  

*As we grow up together*  
*I know that well be forever*  
*There's no one more perfect than me and you*  

My baby, my honey bear  
You can call me snuggly bunches mccudikns and I don't really care  
We'll take our dogs for a walk in the park  
We'll sit on a bench and we'll talk  
Some people will come by and say you too look so cute today  
And we'll say we know  
and you mean us three  

*As we grow up together*  
*I know that well be forever*  
*There's no one more perfect than me and you*  

But days without your face seem so damn long  
I love to hear your voice when we talk on the phone  
But its not enough I need you here  
I need you here in my arms  

*As we grow up together*  
*I know that well be forever*  
*Well fair through any kind of weather*  
*It will always be perfect you know its true-*
