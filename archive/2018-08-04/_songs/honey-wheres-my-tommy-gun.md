Jump a mojito baby, put a paper plate on your head  
Your a sweet shadow shirt lady, I'd like to see you when you shed  
Don't you break that shillelagh mama, this aint its first award show do you dig?  
That's not a skirt your wearin', that's not a skirt it's a wig  

*Well I was bored before it started*  
*I was bored when it begun*  
*I was bored when we departed*  
*Honey, where's my Tommy Gun*  

I'm certain about your barista, I am certain it can walk  
I've seen it lickin lightning bulbs, I've seen it breaking lollipops  
I'm waxing and whining for you, I'm whining with my wine  
I'm scared to meet your poodle, I'm scared of overtime  

*Well I was bored before it started*  
*I was bored when it begun*  
*I was bored when we departed*  
*Honey, where's my Tommy Gun*  

The gates have been left reading, the moat has been on fire  
The sky above is bleeding, its leaking on the open wire  
My skin is screaming soda, fizzle for me twice  
Reach behind your shoulder, put that ring on some peaty ice  

*Well I was bored before it started*  
*I was bored when it begun*  
*I was bored when we departed*  
*Honey, where's my Tommy Gun*  

Walk with Waldo, run with Ramapo  
Bulk with Bravo, piss with Pistachio  
I'm stitching up the gutter, its fence is barely barbed  
I'm blowin' with the barley, I'm wading with the guard  

*Well I was bored before it started*  
*I was bored when it begun*  
*I was bored when we departed*  
*Honey, where's my Tommy Gun*  

Who's that other bottle, who's that other purse  
I'll make their Chester waddle, I'll clip them in with a hearse  
I'm melting mandarin oranges, and pouring them in a bath  
I'm breathing pollen honey, aren't you glad I did the math  

*Well I was bored before it started*  
*I was bored when it begun*  
*I was bored when we departed*  
*Honey, where's my Tommy Gun*  

Ask me to the grocers mothers, I've been there several months  
His sisters and his brothers, are all a couple of runts  
She pours a glass of fabric, it weaves together tight  
I've found that if I wear it, it makes my nostrils bright  

*Well I was bored before it started*  
*I was bored when it begun*  
*I was bored when we departed*  
*Honey, where's my Tommy Gun*
