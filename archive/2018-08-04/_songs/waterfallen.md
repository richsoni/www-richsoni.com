*Well, I fell into a river*  
*I slipped into a stream*  
*My face began to shiver*  
*It was cold I had to scream*  

Baby screeching to help me out  
She's reaching for my shoulder  
But in me there's aint a doubt  
That I'll pull her off that boulder  

I claw at leaves dirt and clovers  
I'm sure my time has come to me  
But, paws, sleeves fill, spurting over  
Then I see the tree  

*Well, I fell into a river*  
*I slipped into a stream*  
*Up the shale cliff i slither*  
*Crawling up a cedar beam*  

My jacket and my rucksack  
My blue jeans and my boots  
Are soaked with mossy plaque  
And nodding beggar tick roots  

Everything had to come off  
Or, I would get bronchitis or the flu  
I didn't want to get a cough  
Plus my fingers where turning blue  

*Well, I fell into a river*  
*I slipped into a stream*  
*Cutting jeans off with a scissor*  
*Testing self esteem*  

Everything in my possession  
Soaked in this whole charade  
I lost it all to a lesson  
For a view of a cascade  

All the signs where clearly shown  
Right before my ignorant eyes  
I heeded none, and to atone  
I lost all my supplies  

*Well, I fell into a river*  
*I slipped into a stream*  
*I fell into a river*  
*It all seemed like a dream*
