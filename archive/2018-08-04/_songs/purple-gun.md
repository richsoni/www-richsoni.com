Swaying in the cane on the Brazos  
Drank tequila till I'm blotto  
Fell down to the ground in the stun of the sun  
When my aim first met the frame of *The Purple Gun*  

Playing stud in the parlor  
My queen found herself a partner  
Shoot for the loot, and the table spun  
But, a drunk can't handle to gamble against *The Purple Gun*  

Ride for El Dorado  
Nothin' could ever stop you  
That's alright boy, while you run  
Your Bella'll dance with the fella with *The Purple Gun*  

Peyote powwow  
Hey, who stole my eyebrow?  
Tap my shoe to the Sioux's drum  
But, my thumb never stammers from the hammer of *The Purple Gun*  

Filled with bravado  
Dueling with the yabbo  
He said nettle my mood and it won't be fun  
But, the last thing he guzzled was the muzzle of *The Purple Gun*
