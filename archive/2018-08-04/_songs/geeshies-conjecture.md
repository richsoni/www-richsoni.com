Two more things I'd like to try  
Before I lay down and die  
The first is to look you in the eye  
And the second is to tell you goodbye  

Well, I walk to the top of your doorstep  
I knock, knock, knock on the door  
Your father he does answer  
Says, you aint alive no mo'  

Three more links of golden chain  
Until I, learn my name  
Woke up to the drizzling rain  
Around the curve of my heart was a pain  

Oh, the lady in red she is crying  
She puts all the willows to shame  
You claim that you don't mind a-dying  
Til, your kids are rolling in pain  

Four high aces in your hand  
Don't make you no less of a man  
Armies and fools at your command  
Can't slow down the speed of the sand  

An angel fell down from the heavens  
He bought you a nine dollar shawl  
He'll take you to the bend if you let him  
He'll dress you like la-belle-et-la ball  

Cresting to the summit of the hill  
There's a man in the ruins of a mill  
Trade a pole for a forty dollar bill  
You never worked and you never will  

Hero was lying this second  
She rarely is telling the truth  
It'll dig at your soul if you let it  
It'll shoot you like Booth in the booth  
It'll shoot you just like John Wilkes Booth
