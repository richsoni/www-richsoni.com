Life's short if your lucky  
Life drags if you aint  
Another bucket of whiskey  
Another gallon of paint  

*I spent some time on Clinch Mountain*  
*With a gallon of gin*  
*Crawling out of the tunnel*  
*Baby, all caved in*  

Goin' West with Magellan  
He knows the road too well  
Pass the streets of Deep Ellum  
Sail the rivers of hell  

*Wished upon a woman*  
*Threw her fan in the wind*  
*When we reach the tunnel*  
*Baby, all caved in*  

Georgie shouts to Magellan  
Throw on a little more coal  
See his mother she's yelling  
Drowning whistle it blows  

*Hit a bend and we tumble*  
*Down the mountain we spin*  
*Almost smash in the tunnel*  
*Baby, all caved in*  

Walking 61 miles  
Toward the land of the free  
Its just me and Magellan  
Magellan & me  

*Blast a whole in the tunnel*  
*Light a fire within*  
*Walk inside and then mumble*  
*'Baby, all caved in'*  

Sitting straight at the table  
Magellan points at his watch  
My legs are galloping stallions  
My hands as cold as a rock  

*Send me back to Clinch Mountain*  
*Grow a beard on my chin*  
*All I see is the tunnel*  
*Baby, all caved in*
