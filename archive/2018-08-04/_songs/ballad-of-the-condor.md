Singing Jenny fading down the street  
Condor finds a phone beneath a tree  
Wonders what its magic word could be  
Sings to it 'Lay down my Henry Lee'  

Jenny works down at the DMV  
Condor fancies him a new ID  
Sends a message signed in Jenny's name  
Now he's a technician from Spokane

Fly, like a bird in the sky  
Running from the FBI  
Wanted dead or alive  
With one eye open all of the night

Condor never stole no dollar bill  
He only was a hacker for the thrill  
Super User DO, AT&T  
Now hes any man he wants to be  

FBI tapping Condor's wire  
But, Condor could smell the distant fire  
Has AT&T reverse the tap  
Now the Fox is in the Condor's trap  

Fly, like a bird in the sky  
Running from the FBI  
Wanted dead or alive  
With one eye open all of the night

FBI knocking down the door  
Condor saw them coming way before  
Chucking all his hard drives off the bridge  
Left a box of donuts in the fridge  

'My kung fu is stronger' Shimo heard  
Tracking down the man who said the word  
Got a scent and tipped the FBI  
Now the Condor is in the Fox's eye

Fly, like a bird in the sky  
Running from the FBI  
Wanted dead or alive  
With one eye open all of the night

FBI knocking down the door  
Condor saw them coming way before  
Chucking all his hard drives off the bridge  
Left a box of donuts in the fridge  

Triggerfishes lure the Condor in  
Lock him in the Lompoc Cali Inn  
46 plus 22 to spend
Living with the rough and rowdy men

Some they say the judge he laid it thick  
Mostly because the news gave him a kick  
Others say that Shimo was corrupt  
Still the Condor had his feathers plucked  

Fly, like a bird in the sky  
Running from the FBI  
Wanted dead or alive  
With one eye open all of the night
