Well its 11 o'clock on a Saturday prowl  
Lookin' for a  lover with a penetrating smile  
I'll keep my hands to myself, gee you feel so nice  

*Hey, let me take you to a basement*  
*You'll look so exotic in the neon light*  
*Babe, you'll get a hot pink paper bracelet*  
*It'll Bring out the blue in your eyes tonight*  

Got your hip tattoo of an upside down cross  
Diggin' the way your riding on the evening bus  
Come along if you trust me, but I wont ask you twice  

*Hey, let me take you to a basement*  
*You'll look so exotic in the neon light*  
*Babe, you'll get a hot pink paper bracelet*  
*It'll Bring out the blue in your eyes tonight*  

We could pound back a few, I know it'll warm us up  
Forget that new movie, forget that expensive night club  
I know a place it'll be just alright, but if you don't wanna come I wont put up a fight  

*Hey, let me take you to a basement*  
*You'll look so exotic in the neon light*  
*Babe, you'll get a hot pink paper bracelet*  
*It'll Bring out the blue in your eyes tonight*
