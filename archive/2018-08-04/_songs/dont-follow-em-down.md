What do you do
When the stem of the crown
Hasn't a clue
Do you follow em' down?

Cuz' its painful to prance
On rickety ground
But, take it for me
Dont follow em' down

When what you believe
Would grieve the chief of the crowd
And, you crave for their charm
Will you follow em' down

Mirrors of words
Surely could purchase their vow
But take it for me
Don't follow em' down

Near the winding whiskey river
Diving ducks can be found
Do you cut in their line?
Do you follow em' down?

I stood at the edge
By a rodeo clown
He cackled and said
Why follow em' down?

When you man has to run
From the heat of the town
And he calls for his shoes
Do you follow him down?

Well, he's too young to die
But, seems ancient somehow
So, wave him goodbye
Don't follow him down

What do you do?
When the stem of the crown
Hasn't a clue
Don't follow em' down
