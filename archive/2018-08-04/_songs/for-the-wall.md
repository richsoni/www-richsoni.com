Baby, I'm sitting on the back of a bus  
There's a pregnant guy that smells like peanuts  
I have to say I hate his guts  

It's crazy the way we aren't living today  
They've jettisoned our heroes astray  
We graduate and waste away  

*All and all is for the wall*  
*For priests and the crowd to judge*  
*No one seems to be into living as much*  

Baby, I feel like I am getting old  
The winter every year gets more cold  
The summer dance just isn't as bold  

Last night I wished upon a shooting star  
But, later found it was a drone  
Sometimes I feel so alone  

*All and all is for the wall*  
*For priests and the crowd to judge*  
*No one seems to be into living as much*
