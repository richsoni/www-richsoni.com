I get a low down feeling  
Thinking 'bout all the evil that I see  
There's people dying  
Just trying to be free  

*This aint a world*  
*To raise your kids*  
*But, it is what it is*  

I'm just doin' me  
Tryin' to keep on keepin on  
All the news that I see  
Lookin' like the letters of John  

*This aint a world*  
*That the angels kiss*  
*But, it is what it is*  

Haters gonna hate  
Gonna hate their way into a war  
The angels at Heaven's Gate will be  
All like what was it you where fighting for?  

*This aint a world*  
*Asking for clenching fists*  
*But, it is what it is*  

*This aint a world*  
*Where it should be mine or his*  
*But, it is what it is*
