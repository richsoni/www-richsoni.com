This article is not about vi vs emacs (they are both on the list!).</p>\n<p>Vi is listed first because it is the standard.  Log into any *nix server and you will have vi.<br>\nEvery developer should be able to login to a fresh system, and edit files.<br>\nLets face it, even emacs users can agree that nano is for n00bs.<br>\nAfter all, its called visudo, not nanosudo.</p>\n<p>If you are not a vimmer, I recommend you learn the basics.  This means just editing a file, and save/quitting.<br>\nIf you prefer a GUI editor, or emacs, thats cool for normal usage, but in emergencies vi should available in your toolbelt.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open your terminal and complete the first quarter of <code>$ vitutor</code></li>\n<li>Use vi to edit config files in the terminal to get used to the commands.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>#Regex</p>\n<p>In addition to vi, regular expressions are universally available.<br>\nFor many developers, their programming career can be broken into <em>before-regex</em> and <em>after-regex</em>.<br>\nThat is because your workflow will vastly increase once you can use regexes in your find and replace operations.</p>\n<p>This will be applicable in your code as well.  You cannot master half of the tools listed in this article without regex expertise, so if you dont know how to write regexes stop and learn right now.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449319432/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1449319432&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=richsonicom-20&quot;\">Regular Expressions Cookbook</a> is how I started learning regex, but it is a bit slow for beginners.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/097873923X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=097873923X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=richsonicom-20\">Textmate: Power Editing for the Mac</a> was the book that actually taught me regex.  Specifically the search chapter.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>#GNU Tools</p>\n<p>Just like regex, GNU tools will change your life.<br>\nThey liberate you from language specific IDE environments, and allow you to get good at something universal.<br>\nEven experts continue to marvel at the power bestowed upon a properly crafted chain of GNU Commands.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>All developers must own <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596003307/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596003307&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=richsonicom-20\">Unix Power Tools</a></li>\n<li>Taco Bell Coding</li>\n<li>Read man pages, you will be surprised at the power some commands have (e.g. man find; man curl; man grep)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>#Bash</p>\n<p>Unlike the formerly mentioned tools shell scripting is something gradually pays off.<br>\nFor me it started with writing small scripts to automate tmux, and make my work easier.<br>\nI mastered bash when I wrote my own customized bash prompt while on a trip in Ireland.</p>\n<p>There are many alternatives to bash out there, and I tried many of them extensively, but have to say that it is not worth the headache.</p>\n<p>Bash has many features that other shells dont, and like vi, bash is usually the standard.<br>\nIt is nice to not have to install Zshell.  Trust me on this.  With my current set up, all I have to do is wget my dotfiles, and run the install script.<br>\nWith a clean up script, you can even do this on a buddy's computer without zapping out his or her files.</p>\n<p>As far as features go, <code>$ set</code> was the command that made me leave zshell.<br>\nMy prompt port is also way faster in bash.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596526784/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0596526784&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=richsonicom-20\">Bash Cookbook</a> really sharpened my skills in a logical order.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>#Javascript</p>\n<p>Javascript is everywhere.  That is why every programmer should master it.  It is like the PERL of the modern time.  Using a friends Windows computer, but you need to do a little rat-tat-tat-tat in a console?  That is where Javascript shines.<br>\nIn addition to its portability, using javascript to do a quick page scrape can save you tons of time.</p>\n<p>I would like to add that you should be using jQuery because it provides a higher level syntax, which is better for rat-tat-tat-tatting.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Javascript, the good parts</li>\n<li>Functional Javascript</li>\n</ol>\n<p>#Emacs</p>\n<p>Emacs is the other of the big two text editors, but holds another special value:  Command line shortcuts, are defaulted to emacs.<br>\nAlthough you can change your inputrc file to use vim mode, it is a little bit janky.</p>\n<p>I ended up customizing myself a hybrid of both.  In short, all master developers need to know both vi and emacs, no exceptions.</p>\n<p>Vimmers, if you want the respect of emacs users, know how to use their editor when you are pairring.<br>\nThe same goes for emacs users.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong></p>\n<p>#SQL</p>\n<p>SQL is one common denominator that spreads across almost all application domains.<br>\nMaster SQL, and master it early.  It will pay off in the long run, I promise.<br>\nI noticed that many senior level developers can join a team, and scale up their ability to contribute, and debug an existing project by poking around in the database.</p>\n<p>Most databases use SQL, so if you learn one you will be able to ramp up quickly in another.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>unfortunately none.  Learning SQL is something I learned in a college class, and I am very happy I did.  Fortunately the basics are easy to pick up. Just ask a colleage to teach you, and practice a lot.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>#Markdown</p>\n<p>Markdown is the newest tool on my own belt, but one of the most useful.<br>\nIt is so awesome that once you learn it, you will begin to insist that your workplace integrates it into its project management software.<br>\nI write my meeting notes, readmes, code documentation, and even my blog posts in markdown.</p>\n<p>It is the solution to the plaintext, no syntax highlight problem.<br>\nThe only problem is there is no quick way to just pick up markdown.</p>\n<p>I suggest you start with headings and lists, and then slowly add the features you need.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong></p>\n<p>#Tmux</p>\n<p>For some reason Tmux is a hard sell, but it is so awesome.<br>\nI dont use the terminal without it.<br>\nI will just list why I like it, and how to learn it.<br>\nUnderstand that it is on this list, and when you learn it, you will be so surprised that no one wants to learn it.</p>\n<p>Tmux lets you:  save ssh sessions, remote pair via ssh, split panes, use vimux, organize and automate you development environment, rapidly switch context.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong></p>\n<p>#R</p>\n<p>R is another tool I learned in college.  In my opinion, it has the steepest learning curve out of all the tools in this article.<br>\nHowever, it saves you the headache of using Excel.</p>\n<p>I mostly use it to dynamically generate graphs.  I use this to monitor personal stats (e.g. progress and error of transitioning from qwerty to dvorak)</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Reading</strong></p>\n<p>#Git</p>\n<p>Lastly I would recommend learning git, but I would not go as far as saying you have to learn it.<br>\nI have used most of the popular SVN systems, and I find git to be the most complete, and simple once understood.<br>\n<strong>Recommended Reading</strong></p>\n","frontmatter":"layout: post\ncategories: Coding\navatar: \"http://www.vtxoa.com/forums/customavatars/avatar31627_1.gif\"\nhero: \"http://www.unleashthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/yoda-quotes.jpeg\"\ntags: [coding, self development]\ndepricated: true\ntitle: '10 Skills Every Developer Should Master'\ndate: 2013-12-02"},"2013-12-02-practical-vim":{"attributes":{"layout":"post","categories":["Book Reviews"],"avatar":"http://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1934356980&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=richsonicom-20","hero":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DZSBfwndL._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg","tags":["book reviews","vim","coding"],"blurb":"A great book for a vim user at any level to sharpen their skills","title":"Book Review: Practical Vim","date":"2013-12-02T00:00:00.000Z"},"body":"<hr>\n<h1>Recommendations</h1>\n<p><strong>Beginner Takeaways</strong>: 3/10</p>\n<p><strong>Intermediate Takeaways</strong>: 10/10</p>\n<p><strong>Expert Takeaways</strong>: 7/10</p>\n<p><strong>Readability</strong>: 10/10</p>\n<h1>Takeaways</h1>\n<p>All vimmers should know three names: Tim Pope, Learn Vim The Hard Way Guy, and Drew Neil.</p>\n<p>Tim Pope writes the best vim plugins hands down.</p>\n<p>Drew Neil runs the vimcasts website.</p>\n<p>Practical Vim is a treasure trove of vim tips.<br>\nAny vimmer will take a ton of stuff out of this book.<br>\nIf you have used vimcasts before, understand that this book is not the same.</p>\n<p>...It is 1,000x better.</p>\n<p>I really like vimcasts, but Practical Vim knocks it out of the park.<br>\nI read this book in 4 days while on vacation.

I found the IP address that my page should point to (<code>204.232.175.78</code>) on <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages\">this page</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><h4> Configure Your Jekyll Site </h4></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Open _config.yml, and edit its contents.  If you want to copy mine <a href=\"https://github.com/richsoni/richsoni.github.com/blob/master/_config.yml\">its here</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Start jekyll by running <code>jekyll serve -w</code> the <code>-w</code> tells it to regenerate the files when you save.  Note: all files are generated in the _publish folder which is in the .gitignore file by default when you run <code>jekyll new</code> (i.e. they are only for development)</p></li>\n<li><p>Navigate to localhost:4000 to view your site</p></li>\n<li><p>Cut up your template into Jekyll.  I used <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/\">the documentation</a>, but here are some quick tips to get started.</p>\n<p>a. The _layouts folder contains templates that will wrap around all files that use it (declared in the YAML <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/\">Front Matter</a>\nyou render the page content in liquid by putting <code>{ {content} }</code>\nb. To generate partials, create a file in the _includes folder, and put <code>{ % include filename % }</code>\nc. You can declare any variable in the <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/\">Front Matter</a>, and use it in the template.  It is not reserved for Jekyll only vars\nd. Use _data to declare static data in yaml.  I used this for my Project blurb section.\ne. If you want to use markdown but not in a blog post, you can.  Just write it and Jekyll will compile it to html.  For example, ``projects/carbon.md =&gt; projects/carbon.html' which can be navigated to in the browser.\nThese files also can leverage <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/\">Front Matter</a>, so slap a layout around it.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<p><h3 id='a1'>A1) My Namecheap DNS Settings</h3></p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-string\">Host</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">Name:</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">@</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-attr\">  IP:</span>  <span class=\"hljs-number\">204.232</span><span class=\"hljs-number\">.175</span><span class=\"hljs-number\">.78</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-attr\">  Type:</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">A</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">(Address)</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-string\">Host</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">Name:</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">www</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-attr\">  IP:</span>  <span class=\"hljs-string\">richsoni.github.io.</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-attr\">  Type:</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">CNAME</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">(Alias)</span>\n</code></pre>\n","frontmatter":"layout: post\ncategories: [coding]\navatar: '/blog/images/github_pages_small.png'\nhero: '/blog/images/github_pages.png'\ntags: coding\nblurb: 'The experience is painless, and fruitful.

To take the most value home you should interact with people from cultures besides your own.\nI find this lesson to apply well to every day life as well.  Maybe instead of listening to music on the train, I could take time to learn about those sitting next to me every once and a while.</li>\n<li><em>The tourist destinations have value.</em>  Often people, like myself, shun the idea of visiting tourist destinations.  Indeed they are overloaded with kids crying, people smelling, photo bombing, long bathroom lines, and overpriced food and beverages.  However, they are so popular for a reason, and there is a lot of culture to be absorbed through the chaos.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are just a few of the tips I took away from the book.

free to skip to <a href='#theTips'>The Tips</a></strong>.</p>\n<h1>What Globbing Is</h1>\n<p>Globbing lets you be more ambiguous with the way you specify input to your computer.\nTo glob an input use the <code>*</code> operator in place of more specific text.</p>\n<p>Make sure you have globbing enabled in your shell ( See Next Section ) before delving into <em><a href='#seeGlobbingInAction'>Seeing globbing in Action</a></em> .</p>\n<p><h1 id='enableGlobbing'>Enable Globbing</h1></p>\n<p>By default your bash instance should have an option called globbing enabled.\nTo check run the following command:</p>\n<pre><code>\n<span class=\"hljs-symbol\">$</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">set</span> -o |<span class=\"hljs-comment\"> grep glob</span>\n  noglob      <span class=\"hljs-comment\">off</span>\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>The examples in this article rely on that option to be set, so make sure globbing is enabled ( <code>noglob off</code> ).\nIf it says <code>noglob on</code> you will need to enable globbing.\nThere are two ways to do this.</p>\n<pre><code>\n## Temporary <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">Method</span>\n$  <span class=\"hljs-title\">set</span> -<span class=\"hljs-title\">o</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">noglob</span>\n$  <span class=\"hljs-title\">set</span> -<span class=\"hljs-title\">o</span> | <span class=\"hljs-title\">grep</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">glob</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-title\">noglob</span>      <span class=\"hljs-title\">off</span>\n\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>A more

id='seeGlobbingInAction'>See Globbing In Action</h1></p>\n<p>To get a feel for how globbing works, just give it a try.</p>\n<p>As an example lets use some globbing in my Blog Posts

the previous example the <code>*</code> is expanded to every file in the folder.</p>\n<pre><code>\n$ echo <span class=\"hljs-number\">2014</span>*\n<span class=\"hljs-number\">2014</span>-<span

class=\"hljs-number\">2014</span>-vim-tips.txt\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice how the glob worked in the previous command.  It told the <code>echo</code> command to print all the files that start with <code>2014</code>.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<pre><code>\n$ echo *<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.txt</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-number\">2014</span>-vim-tips<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.txt</span> vimstuff<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.txt</span> c<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.txt</span>\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Putting the <code>*</code> first switches the way the glob works.  Instead of matching the beginning, the command grabs all the files that end with the text after the <code>*</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>\n$ echo *vim*\n<span class=\"hljs-number\">2013</span><span

around some text will look for it anywhere in the input.\nNotice that the <code>*</code> will match <code>vimstuff.txt</code>, this shows that the star can match nothing as well as something.</p>\n<pre><code>\n$ echo <span class=\"hljs-number\">20</span>*vim*\n<span class=\"hljs-number\">2013</span><span class=\"hljs-number\">-12</span><span

globs.</p>\n<p><h1 id='theTips'>The Tips</h1></p>\n<p>Here are some of my favorite ways to use globbing.\nYou will find your own unique ways as well, but this will be a good handful to get your feet

Opened Mind</h1>\n<p>Some time ago, I read about The Beatles' song writing techniques.\nAll of the techniques are both clever and sensible.</p>\n<h3>Here's my favorite</h3>\n<p>They didn't write down the tune or melody of new songs.\nThis was not out of laziness, but a way to filter out the unmemorable songs.\nThe post,\n<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/the-beatles/10321180/The-Beatles-the-birth-of-the-band.html\">The Beatles: the birth of the band</a>\ndescribes the technique:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If they couldn't remember something the next day, they could hardly expect it to stick in the mind of anyone else</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Beatles understood the importance of getting a song stuck in a listener's memory.\nThey didn't let their conscious judgement choose which songs would or wouldn't be catchy.\nInstead, they let their subconsciouses filter the dull songs right out of their mind.</p>\n<p>That idea stuck inside of my own mind.\nI tried applying the technique to things that I do.\nAfter some successful experimentation, I fully adopted the technique into my own workflow.</p>\n<h3>It's Not Just For Songwriting</h3>\n<p>The technique has proven to be great tool for songwriting.\nIt can't be denied that The Beatles wrote perhaps the most catchy songs of all time.\nHowever, this technique can be used to do much more than write songs.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, it forces your focus on the most important task at hand.\nIn the creative mind, ideas drift in and drift out all day.\nSome thoughts keep coming up, over and over again, these are often the best ideas.</p>\n<p>There are many tasks which engage the creative side of the mind.\nWe can apply the technique in any of those situations.\nThe book\n<a

skills every developer should master</a>.\nIt takes <a href=\"https://www.bitcast.io/b/tmux-tunes-week-1\">one week</a> to get started, and saves hours of work and frustration.</p>\n<p>Tmux is a modern incarnation of the GNU Screen program.\nBetween the two, tmux has a more active group of developers.\nAs such, most open tmux bugs are usually fixed faster.\nGreater development activity, and added features are why I use tmux over Screen.\nHowever, this article mostly showcases basic features which both technologies include.</p>\n<p>Feel free to give either program a try.\nBoth improve a workflow in essentially the same way.\nIt's easy to switch between using either program because they are very similar.</p>\n<h1>Why use tmux?</h1>\n<p>Answer the following questions to evaluate if tmux can benefit you:</p>\n<div height='1px'></div>\n<ul style='list-style:none; border-left: 0px'>\n  <li><label style='font-weight:normal'><input type='checkbox'/> I often ssh into another box from the terminal</label></li>\n  <li><label style='font-weight:normal'><input type='checkbox'/> I have more than three terminal tabs open on a regular basis</label></li>\n  <li><label style='font-weight:normal'><input type='checkbox'/> I like to look at two terminal windows side by side</label></li>\n  <li><label style='font-weight:normal'><input type='checkbox'/> I use ( or want to learn ) vi, vim, gvim, or MacVim</label></li>\n  <li><label style='font-weight:normal'><input type='checkbox'/> My project workflows are complicated to set up, and should be automated</label></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you answered <strong>yes to any</strong> of those questions, then tmux will be useful to you.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It can improve the stability, and increase the execution speed of workflows.</li>\n<li>It enables visualization of problems in a new way.</li>\n<li>It is easy to install, and works on most *nix platforms.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>How does it work?</h1>\n<p>Tmux stands for terminal multiplexer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>tmux = <em>t<span style='color:#7f7f7f'>erminal</span> mu<span style='color:#7f7f7f'>ltiple</span>x<span style='color:#7f7f7f'>er</span></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A terminal multiplexer is a program that can load many terminal windows within one.\nDon't let this complex verbiage discourage you!!!\nUsing tmux is not very complicated, I promise.</p>\n<p>The tmux man page (<code>$ man tmux</code>) explains the features that tmux offers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span style='color:#7f7f7f'>(tmux) enables a</span> number of terminals <span style='color:#7f7f7f'>to be created,\naccessed, and controlled from a</span> single screen.  <span style='color:#7f7f7f'>tmux may be detached from a\nscreen and continue </span> running in the background, <span style='color:#7f7f7f'>then later </span>reattached.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tmux is a service that runs in the background.\nWhen attached to a tmux session, it enables interaction with the windows it controls.\nWhen the attached shell exits; tmux <em>detaches</em>, but remains running in the background.\nAs such, a separate shell can <em>reattach</em> back into the tmux session.\nThe session will continue in tmux with or without attached users.\nAny running programs in the session operate as if they were active the whole time.</p>\n<p>Tmux can manage multiple sessions at the same time.\nWithin each session, any number of windows can be created.\nWindows can also be split into both vertical and horizontal panes.\nTmux can be controlled by scripts, and automate repetitive workflow tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Go Learn It</strong>:\n<a href=\"#WhatToDo\">Skip down to a list of next steps</a> if you are sold on giving tmux a try.</p>\n<h1>Use Cases</h1>\n<p>Here are a few example use cases for tmux.\nThey highlight some ways that tmux can be used to improve day to day workflows.\nPlease share your own use cases in the <a href=\"#Comments\">comments</a> section.</p>\n<h2>Debugging</h2>\n<p>A certain workflow is more efficient with two windows aligned next to each other e.g. code and server, code and console ect.</p>\n<h3>Without Tmux</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Manually arrange windows next to each other.</li>\n<li>During the day resize them, and continually realign them.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>With Tmux</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Split the current tmux window into two panes</li>\n<li>resize the terminal window, and tmux will proportinally resize the panes</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"img-responsive media-object\" src='/blog/images/tmux_split.gif' alt=\"miniature-article\"></p>\n<h2>SSH</h2>\n<p>An external box needs to run a long script ( like an install script )</p>\n<h3>Without Tmux</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>SSH into the machine and start the script</li>\n<li>Keep the session open because ending it will close all processes, and the script will fail.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>With Tmux</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>SSH into the machine and start tmux</li>\n<li>Start the script and feel free to disconnect ( on purpose, or accidentally)</li>\n<li>Later on, ssh back in and attach to the tmux session to check on the progress</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"img-responsive media-object\" src='/blog/images/tmux_ssh.gif' alt=\"miniature-article\"></p>\n<h2>Accidentally Closing A Bunch Of Tabs</h2>\n<p>There are a bunch of terminal tabs and windows open.\nAt some point another app needs to be closed.\nHowever, the terminal application gets closed by accident.\nNow, the lost terminal windows need to be restored.</p>\n<h3>Without Tmux</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Individually open each tab again, and be extra careful next time</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>With Tmux</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Open a new terminal window and attach to the tmux session, everything is still there.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"img-responsive media-object\" src='/blog/images/tmux_accident.gif' alt=\"miniature-article\"></p>\n<h2>Morning set up</h2>\n<p>On a certain project, several tasks need to be completed before work can begin e.g.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-meta\">$</span><span class=\"bash\"> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">cd</span> project</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">$</span><span class=\"bash\"> git pull</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">$</span><span class=\"bash\">

class=\"bash\"> start db</span>\n[Open a new tab]\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">$</span><span class=\"bash\"> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">cd</span> project</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">$</span><span class=\"bash\"> start console</span>\n[Open a new tab]\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">$</span><span class=\"bash\"> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">cd</span> project</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">$</span><span class=\"bash\"> vim .</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Without Tmux</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Individually open each tab, and run each command in sequence</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>With Tmux</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Write a tmux script that opens all the tabs, and executes commands in sequence</li>\n<li>Meanwhile, go and talk with a buddy about how awesome Bob Dylan is.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img class=\"img-responsive media-object\" src='/blog/images/tmux_scripted.gif' alt=\"miniature-article\"></p>\n<h1>What to do</h1>\n<p>This article intentionally does not

bring tools that they prefer/can afford to put in their toolbox.</p>\n<p>Likewise, software development shops do not dictate required tools to engineers.\nBoth occupations defer the tool selection to the workers.\nThese workers must settle between obtaining quality tools and paying affordable prices.\nThis carte blanche custom promotes mastery of tools that are pervasive throught a career.</p>\n<h2>Some tools endure</h2>\n<p>The lifspan of applicability varies amongst different tools.\nSome are brief trends while others linger for decades.\nIt is wise to strive for mastery of matured tools.\nThey have proven their value, and will endure long enough for users to reach an expert level.</p>\n<p>This article describes 10 software programs that all developers should master.\nThey are free, applicable to many jobs, and maintained by mature open source projects.\nStriving to master these tools will pay off over an entire career.</p>\n<p>Here is my shortlist of

installation which is sometimes out of scope.</p>\n<p>Additionally, vi has a reputation of making text editing breathtakingly efficient.\nBecause of this, many developers, including myself, use <a

the strength of a culture is the only thing we can truly rely on ~ p. 130</blockquote>\n<p>The <em>Circle of Safety</em> is a group within a team which we both confide in and protect.\nA shallow Circle of Safety is an indicator of a toxic team culture and poor leadership.\nSmall circles, expose the company to internal competition and threats.\nWidening the circle removes the team's focus on internal threats, so they can concentrate on achieving goals.\nAs such, leaders should strive to widen Circles of Safety within their teams.</p>\n<p>In\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DGZKQM8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DGZKQM8&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20\">Leaders Eat Last</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=richsonicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00DGZKQM8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />,\nSinek suggests several ways to widen the Circle of Safety.\nOne suggestion is to focus on relationships instead of numbers.\nBy doing this leaders assure team members that they are not going to relinquish them for short term financial gains.\nExpanding the circle makes the team a differentiating asset against competition.</p>\n<h1>Protect The Pack</h1>\n<blockquote style='clear:none'>Managers must become leaders in their own right, which means they must take responsibility for the care and protection of those in their charge ~ p. 115</blockquote>\n<p>Leaders build trust with a team by holding up a shield and protecting them from both internal and external threats.\nThe leader needs to defend from external treats like recession, competition, and regulation enclosing the circle.\nLeaders also need to prevent internal threats from poisoning the team culture by eliminating toxic behavior.</p>\n<p>Leaders need to earn the respect of followers.\nIf the leader is weak, followers will not respect their authority.\nFollowers want to be lead by a great leader.\nWhen following a great leader, the team can band together and accomplish great things.</p>\n<h1>Trust The Team</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We work to advance the vision of a leader who inspires us and we work to undermine a dictator who means to control us ~ p. 139</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mutual trust is a requirement for all members within a Circle of Safety.\nWhen excluded from the circle, team members are forced to fend for themselves.\nThey must fight to secure their own position, even if it compromises the team's integrity or its goals.\nConversely, when teammates are not in competition they can band together, and work on achieving bigger goals.</p>\n<p>An important part of leadership is having faith in the team to do a great job.\nAll members need to be appreciated and acknowledged for their contribution to the teams goals.\nActions like scaremongering and micromanaging blockade members from obtaining the trust of their leader.\nWhen leaders trust their team, they are inviting them to contribute to something bigger than themselves.\nThis makes everyone feel good, and inspires the whole team to do great things.</p>\n<p>True leaders enable the team to thrive, and allow them to accomplish something greater than any one person could alone.</p>\n<h1>Leader is Not A Rank</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rank of office is not what makes someone a leader. Leadership is the choice to serve others with or without any formal rank ~ p. 66</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To gain the teams trust a leader must fulfill certain expectations.\nOne such expectation is the leader will put their own interests behind those of the team ( e.g. eat last ).</p>\n<p>A leader is the team member that inspires the rest of the team to achieve its goals.\nA leader can reside in any section of a teams hierarchy.\nManagers are not always the leader of a team.\nLikewise, leaders are not always in management positions.</p>\n<p>The followers choose the leader.\nA rank or position does not dictate who a leader is.\nIt is the level of belief the followers have in the leader to provide leadership to the team that chooses the leader.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DGZKQM8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DGZKQM8&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20\">Leaders Eat Last</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=richsonicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00DGZKQM8\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;

zone, any distraction compromises valuable productivity energy.\nThe point of Zen Mode is to take charge over distraction.\nIt is human nature to yield to distractions e.g. changing the font, tweaking formatting, checking email alerts, instant messages, notifications.\nZen Mode, forces such distractions to wait their turn (e.g. Pomodoro Breaks) to become visible / engaged with.</p>\n<p>Zen Mode, also known as distraction free mode, stretches a single window across the entirety of a computer screen's real estate.\nZen Mode typically removes any extra cruft and chrome from the application to minimize distraction e.g. menus, toolbars, notifications.\nMost applications provide a simple <em>Poor Man's Zen Mode</em> i.e. fullscreen, for free.\nMany Operating Systems event offer native support for this kind of thing.\nMake use of these at a minimum, but use real Zen Mode when its available since its less distracting.</p>\n<h3>Tips</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Mac OS X users should upgrade to Mavericks

elements creates a stronger effect than each do on their own.\nCherry-picking elements that are easy to integrate into your current workflow is not as effective as adapting the workflow to fully integrate TOPZ.</p>\n<p>These rules are the [Minimum Effective Dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_dose_(pharmacology) for monstrous productivity gains.</p>\n<h2>Easy Access To Todo.txt</h2>\n<p>Todo.txt needs to be accessible at all times while working.\nDuring Pomodoros, use it to jot down digressions that should be considered later (possibly on break).\nThis will relieve your memory of that thought, and bring focus back to the current task.\nThe faster this is completed the better, so enable Todo.txt to be just a keystroke away.\nDipping into Todo.txt should barely waiver your concentration.</p>\n<p><em>Warning</em>: switching to Todo.txt should not induce further distraction e.g. having YouTube opened next to the window with your Todo.txt.</p>\n<h2>Manage Pomodoro In Todo.txt</h2>\n<p>It makes sense to manage Pomodoro with Todo.txt since <a href=\"#EasyAccessToTodotxt\">rule #1</a> advises that it should always be one keystroke away.\nUsing a separate application is overkill, and adds too many variables to the process.\nFollow these tips to adapt Todo.txt to support the handful of functionality that Pomodoro requires.</p>\n<p>Begin all non-todo-item lines with a comment symbol (the <code>#</code>).\nThis denotes that the line ignores the Todo.txt rules.\nAs such, it is an easy way to augment Todo.txt in a sane way.</p>\n<p>Log Pomodoros (in groups of four) as they are completed, and interuppted:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-meta\"> #</span><span class=\"bash\">completed   XXXX XX</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\"> #</span><span class=\"bash\">interrupted XX</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>Geek Tip:</em> These tallies can be put into a daily log at the end of the day, so they can be analyzed if desired.</p>\n<p>Keep a section where the next few Pomodoros get fleshed out:</p>\n<pre><code> #POM\n (<span class=\"hljs-name\">A</span>)  get order show form working with child serialize\n (<span class=\"hljs-name\">B</span>)  Investigate - Residental Checkbox\n (<span class=\"hljs-name\">B</span>)  Residental Checkbox\n</code></pre>\n<p>Quickly revise this plan at the beginning of each break to ensure its accuracy.\nThis section helps manage expectation with stakeholders by having an up to date estimate of how long a task will take.</p>\n<p>Tasks get placed in the <code>#inbox</code> when concieved during a Pomodoro.\nThey will be categorized and prioritized at a later time, and then placed into the <code>#backlog</code> section.\nThe tasks planned for the current day go into the <code>#today</code> section.</p>\n<pre><code> <span class=\"hljs-selector-id\">#inbox</span>\n Dentist Appointment\n A B testing\n carbonseats<span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.com</span>\n\n <span class=\"hljs-selector-id\">#today</span>\n (A) Finish up testing\n\n <span class=\"hljs-number\">#bac</span>klog\n (A) +HOME Paperwork\n (A) +HOME Fold Laundry\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Every Pomodoro Has A Goal</h2>\n<pre><code> #POM\n (<span class=\"hljs-name\">A</span>)  get order show form working with child serialize\n (<span class=\"hljs-name\">B</span>)  Investigate - Residental Checkbox\n (<span class=\"hljs-name\">B</span>)  Residental Checkbox\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each Pomodoro has a distinct goal.\nTasks need to be broken into bite sized chunks that can be completed during 1 Pomodoro.\n<strong>This is super important.</strong>\nIt cuts the cruft out of task completion because getting off track will only diverge the current Pomodoro.\nBy revising the plan during the break, the big picture is continually brought back into perspective.</p>\n<h2>Don't Break Pomodoros At All Costs</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Atomic Unit of time is a Pomodoro.  A Pomodoro is Indivisible\n~ Francesco Cirillo (Inventor of Pomodoro)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Pomodoros should never be paused, and never be stopped.</em>\nIf the Pomodoro is interrupted then a fresh one needs to be started.\nFinishing early means there is time to reprioritize the task list, or to start on the next task.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#OffCycleWork\">Off Cycle Work</a> is the easiest way to sidestep external distraction.\nHowever, during regular work hours Pomodoro should still be used.\nIf a distraction arises, try saying &quot;I am currently busy, can I sync up with you in 15 (or whenever the Pomodoro is done)?&quot;\nPlanned distraction is fine, Pomodoro promotes long breaks in which any activity can be done.\nHowever, the work time is sacred and should be treated respectfully.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> There are always exceptions to this rule, please use your own discretion when telling superiors to wait.</p>\n<h2>Schedule Distraction Activities</h2>\n<p>As stated above, planned distraction is a healthy part of being productive.\nThis is true as long as it is planned, and does not interfere with actual work.\nChecking Twitter, chatting by the coffee machine, or even personal chores need to get done.\nIf they are suppressed then the ability to focus on work will be suboptimal.</p>\n<p>By planning a Pomodoro to have a meeting, or to read reddit helps control the distraction.\nWhen the distraction Pomodoro or break is over, its time to get back to work.\nThere is always the next break to continue with this activity.</p>\n<h2>Don't Leave Zen Mode Until Work Is Done</h2>\n<p>Stay in Zen Mode as often as possible.\nThis is true even for email applications, and web browsing.\nFocusing on one thing at a time will yield the highest quality results at the quickest speed.\nThis is true even for chatting a friend up on LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>Avoid non Zen Mode Applications as much as possible as they will derail the goal of the Pomodoro.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>In summary, managing distraction is the key to being ultra productive.\nTo wrangle distraction, both internal and external interruptions must be eschewed.\nThe TOPZ method is a foundation for creating a workflow which avoids distraction.\nIt is regimented yet simplistic.\nBy following some guidelines TOPZ provide a structure which enables you to be super productive.\nTOPZ is designed to be learned, and get out of the way.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<p><em>I only recommend products I use and endorse.\nIf you choose to take my recommendations please use the following links, so I can recieve affiliate credit.\nIf I do not have affiliate links to your favorite site, please let me know so I can use them in the future.</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://todotxt.com/\">Official Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/The-Todo.txt-Format\">Todo.txt Formatting Rules</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/todo.txt-touch/id491342186?mt=8&uo=4\" target=\"itunes_store\">The Official Todo.txt iPhone App</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-nearest-starbucks/id446983581?mt=8&uo=4\" target=\"itunes_store\">Find Nearest Starbucks</a> App</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoroapp/id705103149?mt=12&amp;uo=4\">PomodoroApp</a> <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pomodoroapp/id705103149?mt=12&uo=4\" target=\"itunes_store\" style=\"display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;background:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets//images/web/linkmaker/badge_macappstore-sm.png) no-repeat;width:81px;height:15px;@media only screen{background-image:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/htmlResources/assets//images/web/linkmaker/badge_macappstore-sm.svg);}\"></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3981567900/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=3981567900&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20&linkId=JDSVLCXRUREJC6GR\">The Official Pomodoro Book</a><img src=\"http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=richsonicom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=3981567900\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important;

will fly away like a dream and not be found; he will be chased away like a vision of the night. ~ Job 20:8</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Training yourself to remember dreams hinges upon informing your mind of their importance to you.</p>\n<h4>Start a dream journal.</h4>\n<p>It is a strange habit, but the most effective way to increase dream recall.\nHave it ready to write down the dreams you remember.\nDont fret lack of recall when starting, as it will pick up as time goes on.\nI began by only remembering about one per week, but now recall multiple every night.</p>\n<p>You may start to remember only trickles or emotions of dreams, but write them down.\nAfter a while you will remember long epics that can take up multiple pages.\n<a

Integration","categories":["vim","productivity"],"avatar":"/blog/images/eclipse.jpg","hero":"/blog/images/eclipse.jpg","tags":["technology","vim","productivity"],"revision":11,"blurb":"Snuffing out a personal pet peeve of mine, and sharing it with you"},"body":"<h1>Motivation</h1>\n<p>&lt;a https://github.com/richsoni/vim-ecliptic&gt;View Github Repo</a></p>\n<p>Juggling between vim's local clipboard and the system clipboard can be a headache.\nThe plus register (e.g. <code>&quot;+yy</code>,  <code>&quot;+p</code>) hinders workflows that require even minimal clipboard use.\nThe register is buried behind a handful of keystrokes, which are not conveniently placed.</p>\n<h3>What Happens In Vim Stays In Vim</h3>\n<p>Ecliptic is for users who find vim's builtin solution (<code>:set clipboard=unamedplus</code>) incompatable with their workflow.\nWhen using <code>unamedplus</code>, the system clipboard gets polluted with the text of every yank and delete command.\nPerpetually binding the clipboard to the unnamed register can be confusing and annoying to users.\nThe unamed register is frequently modified more than the clipboard is used.\nTherefore, it is my opinion that the <code>unnamed</code> register does more harm than good.</p>\n<h1>Enter Ecliptic</h1>\n<p>Ecliptic maps the power of <code>&quot;+</code> to any keystroke prefix.\nOut of the box this mapping is the <code>c</code> character (mneumonic for clipboard).\nBy default, vim only uses <code>c</code> an operator command, so many <code>c-letter</code> bindings are unmapped.\nEcliptic's standard mappings do not clobber default vim functionality.</p>\n<h2>Ecliptic Scratch</h2>\n<p>The command <code>cb</code> represents e<code>c</code>liptic-<code>b</code>uffer.\nThis will open a scratch buffer containing contents of the clipboard (<code>+</code>\nregister).</p>\n<p>Each edit to this buffer will replace the clipboard with entirety of the\nbuffer.</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n  <td><code> cb </code></td>\n  <td>open ecliptic scratch buffer</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td><code> <C-L> </code></td>\n  <td>refresh an opened ecliptic scratch buffer with current clipboard contents</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<h1>Examples</h1>\n<p>* <em>cursor position represented by [ ]</em></p>\n<table>\n  <thead> <tr> <td> Before </td> <td> Command </td> <td> Result </td> </tr> <thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n        buffer:<i>\"[A]nd, you ask why I don't live here?\"</i><br>\n        clipboard: <i>foobar</i><br>\n        unnamed: <i>baz</i>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        <code>dW cyy </code>\n      </td>\n      <td>\n        vim line:<i>\"And, [y]ou ask why I don't live here?\"</i><br>\n        clipboard: <i>\"you ask why I don't live here?\"</i><br>\n        unnamed: <i>And,</i>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n<pre><code>&lt;tr&gt;\n  &lt;td&gt;\n    cursor at start of line:&lt;i&gt;&quot;[H]oney how come you don't move&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n    clipboard:

]how come you don't move&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n    clipboard: &lt;i&gt;Babe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n    unnamed: &lt;i&gt;Honey&lt;/i&gt;\n  &lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n</code></pre>\n

clipboard</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<h1>Customization</h1>\n<p>By default, Ecliptic sets the prefix to <code>c</code>(a mneumonic for clipboard).\nThis can be changed by setting the <code>g:ecliptic_prefix</code> variable in the <code>.vimrc</code> file.</p>\n<p>Here is an exampe remapping the prefix to the <code>-</code> key:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:ecliptic_prefix</span> = <span class=\"hljs-string\">'-'</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now commands like <code>-yy</code>, and <code>-p</code> will invoke Ecliptic commands.</p>\n<h1>Installation</h1>\n<h2>+Cliboard Requirement</h2>\n<p>Ecliptic makes use of the <code>&quot;+</code> register.\nAccess to this register requires the <code>+clipboard</code> option.\nSince this option is specified during installation, vim will need to be reinstalled for it to be enabled.\nRun the following command to check for <code>+clipboard</code> flag on the current version of vim:</p>\n<pre><code>$ <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span> --<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">version</span> | <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">grep</span> +clipboard || <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">echo</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">'Ecliptic requires +clipboard'</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>If it does not return <em>'Ecliptic requires +clipboard'</em>, then the plugin will work.</p>\n<p>If the flag is missing, then vim needs to be reinstalled.\nInstallation varies system to system.\nHeres an example of how to do it on Mac OS X with homebrew.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-symbol\">$</span> brew install macvim --override-<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">system</span>-vim\n</code></pre>\n<p>A google search can provide directions on how to get a proper vim installation on other systems.</p>\n<h2>Vundle Users</h2>\n<p>Add the following line to the .vimrc</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">Bundle </span><span class=\"hljs-string\">\"richsoni/vim-ecliptic\"</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Pathogen Users</h2>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-meta\">$</span><span class=\"bash\"> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">cd</span> ~/.vim/bundle</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">$</span><span class=\"bash\"> git <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">clone</span>

Activities that display playful cleverness have \"hack value\". ~ Richard Stallman\n</blockquote>\n<p>Richard Stallman's is an acclaimed hacker, and perhaps one of the greatest of all time.\nIn his essay <a href=\"https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html\">On Hacking</a>, he provides great insights on the meaning of both hackers and hacks.</p>\n<p>For Stallman, a hack is composed of 3 elements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>playful</li>\n<li>clever</li>\n<li>explorative</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Stallman claims that something is a hack 'whether useful or not'.\nHowever, he does not mention an important caveat: <em>'a hack solves some problem'</em>.\nEven if the problem something as trivial as <a href=\"https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html\">Stallman using 6 chopsticks at the same time</a>.</p>\n<p>To summarize:</p>\n<pre><code>hack: A playfully, clever <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">and</span> explorative solution <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">to</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">a</span> problem\n</code></pre>\n<h2>The Hacker</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;The true hacker can't just sit around all night; he must pursue some hobby with dedication and flair.&quot; ~ Brian Harvey</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can apply our insights about hacks to hackers as such:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-section\">Initial definitions\n-----------------------------------------------</span>\nhack:   the culmination of a hackers effort\nhacker: one who constructs a hack\n\n<span class=\"hljs-section\">Defined In Previous Section\n-----------------------------------------------</span>\nhack: A playfully, clever and explorative solution to a problem\n\n<span class=\"hljs-section\">Applying Some Algebra\n-----------------------------------------------</span>\nhacker: one who constructs a (hack)\nhacker: one who constructs (a playfully, clever, and explorative solution to a problem)\n</code></pre>\n<p>But, there is more to a hacker than just creating hacks.\nThe following qualities must also be present:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>unquivering passion for an activity</li>\n<li>continually build knowledge and use it to solve problems</li>\n<li>approach activities like a curious child e.g. always have fun</li>\n</ol>\n<aside class='col-xs-12 col-sm-7 col-md-5 col-lg-4'>\n<h2> A Hack Of All Trades </h2>\nUnlike the dictionary, our definitions leave the subject matter to the discretion of the hacker.\nAs an example here is a sampling of some of my favorite hackers:\n<ol>\n<li>  Gina Trapini (Lifehacker) <a href='http://ginatrapani.org/'>site</a> </li>\n<li>  Richard Stallman (Software Hacker) <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman'>wiki</a>, <a href='https://stallman.org/'>site</a> </li>\n<li>  Ramit Sethi (Budget hacker) <a href='http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/'>blog</a>, <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761147489/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0761147489&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20&linkId=T2EOTFOPGVK3KPCS'>book</a> </li>\n<li>  Benny Lewis (Language Hacker) <a href='http://www.fluentin3months.com/'>blog</a>, <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062282697/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062282697&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20&linkId=OG2PZV6AM4QTDB3H'>book </a> </li>\n<li>  Kevin Mitnick (Security Hacker) <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick'>wiki</a>, <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316037729/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316037729&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20&linkId=AQUN4MQHRAIEFERF'>book</a> </li>\n<li>  Rolf Potts (Travel Hacker) <a href='http://www.rolfpotts.com/'>site</a>, <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812992180/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0812992180&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20&linkId=FGX4XXIJEP2FLWSO'>book</a> </li>\n<li>  Vanessa Van Edwards (People Skills Hacker) <a href='http://www.scienceofpeople.com/'>site</a> </li>\n<li>  Tim Feriss (Learning Hacker) <a href='http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/'>blog</a>, <a href='http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0547884591/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0547884591&linkCode=as2&tag=richsonicom-20&linkId=JYM3XBS67WHRRI6N'>book</a> </li>\n<li>  Babak Nivi and Naval Ravikant (Venture Hackers) <a href='http://venturehacks.com/'>blog</a> </li>\n</ol>\n</aside>\n<h1>Round Up</h1>\n<p>So far 2 of the initial questions have been answered:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><s>What qualities define a hacker?</s></li>\n<li><s>How are hackers related to hacks?</s></li>\n<li>How do hackers become hackers?</li>\n<li>What comes first, a hacker, or a hack?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The information from the first questions can be used to answer the last.</p>\n<h1>Which Came First?</h1>\n<blockquote style='clear:none'> \"Was his action, too, a hack? I think so. Is he therefore a hacker? That depends on how much he likes to hack.\" ~ Richard Stallman</blockquote>\n<p>Why did Stallman attempt to <a href=\"https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html\">use 6 chopsticks at the same time</a>?\nAccording to him: <em>'because using three in one hand is hard and ordinarily never thought of, it has &quot;hack value&quot;'</em>.\nBut, only a hacker would find 'hack value' in that.\nNon-hackers would most likely not find merit in attempting it.\nA key ingredient of hacking is an equal pleasure in both the process and the results.\nDue to this, a hacker will dig up value in activities others see no advantage.</p>\n<p>Stallman says, a hacker then is quantified by how much they like to hack (how strong that passion is).\nThat means one has to hack before becoming a hacker.\nHowever, certain hacks will only be attractive to hackers.\nA novice hacker may not find hack-value in activities experts find value in.\nThis leaves us with an interesting catch-22.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the answer is that hacker is a relative term.\nOne becomes a hacker when they meet all of the criteria, but it does not mean that they cannot hack.\nCertain hacks require a hacker, but others may have more 'hack-value' to a non-hacker.\nIn that sense, the hack comes first, but only very briefly.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><s>What qualities define a hacker?</s></li>\n<li><s>How are hackers related to hacks?</s></li>\n<li><s>How do hackers become hackers?</s></li>\n<li><s>What comes first, a hacker, or a hack?</s></li>\n</ol>\n<p>These questions bring forth insights into hackers and their relationships to hacks.\nFor aspiring hackers, these can be checkpoints to strive for.\nThey expose that one should focus on more than hacks if they want to become a hacker.\nMy advise for aspiring hackers is fake it until you make it.\nKeep hacking!!!</p>\n<p>For hackers, understand that you cannot be a hacker in every domain.\nTo become a hacker you have to curate the 3 features a hacker has for that activity.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://stallman.org/articles/on-hacking.html\">On Hacking by Richard

Photo credit to Thomas Fischer Rare Book Library</a></p>\n<h1>Panning for Rubies</h1>\n<p>It is difficult to wrangle long hashes, and big objects when debugging.\nOften times, you know the name of the attribute or method, and need to visually scan through a list.\nRuby has a built in solution to make this process less painful:  The <code>object.methods.grep</code> and <code>hash.keys.grep</code> patterns.\nHere is each one in action:</p>\n<h2>Sifting Arrays</h2>\n<p>Filtering through arrays in Ruby is as easy as using the <code>grep</code> command.</p>\n<pre><code>&gt; hash.methods.length\n =&gt; <span class=\"hljs-number\">147</span>\n&gt; hash.methods.grep /to_/\n=&gt; [<span class=\"hljs-symbol\">:to</span>_hash, <span class=\"hljs-symbol\">:to</span>_h, <span class=\"hljs-symbol\">:to</span>_a, <span class=\"hljs-symbol\">:to</span>_s, <span class=\"hljs-symbol\">:to</span>_enum]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Instead of reading through a list of 147 entries, the programmer can filter it to what is important.</p>\n<h1>Feeling the Pain</h1>\n<p>A common painpoint faced in javascript is sifting through json keys.\nSometimes you know the key is something like <code>reference_number</code>, but <code>object.reference_number</code> is undefined.\nIn this case, you may need to pop open the object and read through the list.\nIf the key was <code>order_reference_number</code> it may be hard to find.\nuspecially in a long list.</p>\n<h1>A Solution</h1>\n<p>Here are two small tools inspired by Ruby's <code>grep</code> to mitigate this pain:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-built_in\">Array</span>.prototype.grep = <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> (<span class=\"hljs-params\">regex</span>) </span>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">this</span>.filter( <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> (<span class=\"hljs-params\">elem</span>) </span>{\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> elem.match(regex)})}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">Object</span>.grepKeys = <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> (<span class=\"hljs-params\">object, regex</span>) </span>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">Object</span>.keys(object)\n    .grep(regex)\n    .reduce(<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">memo, val</span>)</span>{\n      memo[val] = object[val];\n      <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> memo}, {})}\n</code></pre>\n<p>With these methods at hand, wrangling arrays, and objects becomes much simpler:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">&gt; array = [<span class=\"hljs-string\">'foo'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">'bar'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">'baz'</span>]\n&gt; array.grep(<span class=\"hljs-regexp\">/b/</span>)\n[<span class=\"hljs-string\">'bar'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">'baz'</span>]\n&gt; array.grep(<span class=\"hljs-regexp\">/ar/</span>)\n[<span class=\"hljs-string\">'bar'</span>]\n\n&gt; obj = [foo: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>, <span class=\"hljs-attr\">bar</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>, <span class=\"hljs-attr\">baz</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>]\n&gt; <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">Object</span>.grepKeys(obj, /oo/)\n{<span class=\"hljs-attr\">foo</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>}\n&gt; <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">Object</span>.grepKeys(obj, /[^b]/)\n{<span class=\"hljs-attr\">bar</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>, <span class=\"hljs-attr\">baz</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I dont actually use these functions in my application code, but include them to make debugging less painful.</p>\n<h2>For The Faint Hearted</h2>\n<p>Some are weary of overwriting builtin prototypes.\nThis currying solution provided by <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/2maw9q/sifting_for_javascript_ruby_style/\">Ampersand55 on reddit</a> may suit them better than the above solution.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">grep</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(regex)</span> </span>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">(el)</span> </span>{\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> regex.test(el)\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Enjoy, and happy coding!!!</p>\n","frontmatter":"layout: post\ndate: 2014-11-14\ntitle: \"Sifting for Javascript, Ruby

emerges from selection, affinities, integration, love.&quot; ~ Louis Kahn</p>\n</blockquote>\n<aside class='col-xs-6'>\n  <img class='img-responsive' src='/blog/images/four_freedoms_map.png' >\n  <div class='caption'>\n  The Four Freedoms Park, sandwiched between Manhattan and Long Island\n  </div>\n</aside>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.fdrfourfreedomspark.org/\">Four Freedoms Park</a> (image above) is an architectural masterpiece designed by <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/louis-kahn-37884\">Louis Khan</a>.\nThe park's architecture embellishes its riverfront property which lies between Manhattan and Long Island.\nInstead of competing with the environment, <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/louis-kahn-37884\">Khan</a> often designs architecture which leverages it.</p>\n<p>This same principles define well crafted Vimscript.\nCelebrated Vimscript authors (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope\">tpope</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/tommcdo\">tommcdo</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/AndrewRadev\">AndrewRadev</a>) compliment vim's features with their plugins.\nDesign at this level requires a comprehensive understanding of vim, and its swath of functionality.\n<em>Great Vimscript feels natural to vim users</em>.\nThis is just as important as writing something useful.</p>\n<p>If limited to one piece of advice to Vimscript authors, I would offer this:\n<em>Compliment your environment, do not compete with it.</em>\nThis article builds off of this concept, and extends advice on how to author great Vimscript.</p>\n<h1>Building A Foundation</h1>\n<p>Conceptualizing certain ideas is a prerequisite to authoring exceptional Vimscript.\nThese next sections offer a variety of such ideas.\nThe aim is to <em>prime the mind into recognizing good problems to solve with Vimscript</em>, and to compress the learning curve of the language.</p>\n<h2>Customization Over Origination</h2>\n<p>Most Vimscripts serve one of the two following functions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Customize/extend built-in settings</li>\n<li>Enhance the editor with brand new functionality</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In either situation, a single principal prevails:\n<em>Straying from Vim's convictions often creates more work, and a less polished solution.</em>\nIt's not hard to find code that breaks this rule, and it hurts the community when code like gets released.\nIt bloats the codebase, and teaches bad habits.</p>\n<h3>Customization Example: File Browsing</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree\">NerdTree</a> is a popular plugin that enables file browsing a' la TextMate's project drawer.\nThe plugin duplicates a large amount of existing code (netrw), and has a significant functionality flaw.\nDrew Neil eloquently phrases how project drawers and Vim splits mix like <a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/\">Oil and vinegar</a>.</p>\n<p>Another option, <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar\">vim-vinegar</a> plays nicely with splits and leverages existing netrw code.\nInstead of reinventing functionality, vinegar improves netrw with slick configurations.</p>\n<p>What is the gain?<br>\nQualitatively, <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar\">vim-vinegar</a> feels more natural to a user adapted to vim's native functionality.<br>\nQuantitatively, <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar\">vim-vinegar</a> is <em>5x smaller</em> than <a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree\">NerdTree</a> (529 kb vs 2775 kb).</p>\n<h4>Resources</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><code>:h netrw</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar\">vim-vinegar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/\">Oil and vinegar</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree\">NerdTree</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Augmentation Example: Swapping Text</h3>\n<p>Yet, there are circumstances which vim provides no feasable solution.\nA great example is swapping text.\nExamine the example swapping &quot;bar&quot; and &quot;baz&quot; using nothing but stock vim commands.\nIt amounts to 15 keystrokes, and to revert the operation

subpar to these more comprehsive tutorials:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The harder / quicker path: <code>:h usr_41.txt</code></li>\n<li>The easier / slower path:  <a href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/\">Learn Vimscript the Hard Way</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each resource provides detailed information on syntax and technical details required when writing Vimscript.\nThey each take a unique approach to essentially the same material.\n<em>After reading either piece, you should be comfortable with basic Vimscript.</em>\nAlbeit, less palpable aspects may still be insipid.\nThe aim of this article is to fill some of those missing pieces.</p>\n<p>The remaining sections offer tidbits of wisdom I aquired through experience.\nOne section covers Vimscript itself, while the other targets writing plugins.</p>\n<h4>Resources</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><code>:h usr_41.txt</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/\">Learn Vimscript the Hard Way</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Hacking Vim Script</h1>\n<p>Once you know Vimscript, opportunities for productivity boosts emerge.\nThis section presents some ideas that will assist your efforts to learn Vimscript.</p>\n<h2>Don't Prematurely Write Plugins</h2>\n<p>Write Vimscript for yourself before broadcasting it to the world.\n<em>When starting out it's important to write a lot of actual code.</em>\nPlugins require documentation, and degrees of design that bring their own challenges.\nThis will take away from the learning process of the language.</p>\n<h2>Poking The Box</h2>\n<p>Obviously, Vimscript is best written within vim.\nDoing this offers conveniences that are impossible to recreate in another editor.\nNamely, a gateway to an instant feedback loop via runtime evaluation.\n<em>Instead of guessing how a piece of code will behave, vim supports trying it immediately.</em>\nBelow are a handful of methods for evaluating Vimscript at runtime.</p>\n<h3>Evaluating Files</h3>\n<p>The primary runtime evaluation tool is the <code>:source</code> command.\nThis command accepts a path to a file as an argument, and loads it into vim's runtime.\nThis avoids having to close and open vim again.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-vim\">:<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">source</span> ~/.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span>/init/keybindings.<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">vim</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Pro Tips</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Add <code>!</code> to the end of <a href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/23.html\" title=\"Learn Vimscript The Hard Way - Functions\">functions</a>, allowing them to reload.</li>\n<li><code>:so</code> is the same as <code>:source</code></li>\n<li><code>:source %</code> will load the current file</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here are some reloadable code examples:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-vim\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">nmap</span> ge :<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">echo</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'beep'</span>)<span class=\"hljs-symbol\">&lt;CR&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">iabbrev</span> beep boop\ncommand! Beep normal! iboop\u0003\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>! <span class=\"hljs-title\">BeepBoop</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span></span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">echo</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'beep'</span>)\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">endfunction</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Resources</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><code>:h

Hard Way - Functions</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Inspecting</h3>\n<p><em>Command mode is not a REPL</em> for Vimscript.\nAs such, other means of interaction need to exist.\nThe simplest strategy is <a href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/01.html\" title=\"Learn Vimscript The Hard Way - Echoing Messages\">echo</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-vim\">:<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:beep</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">'boop'</span>\n:<span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:beep</span>\n:<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">echo</span>(<span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:beep</span>)\n:<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span> + <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n:<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">echo</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>+<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>)\n</code></pre>\n<p>It's useful to <a

href=\"https://github.com/tpope\">Tpope</a>'s <a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-scriptease\">scriptease</a> plugin offers some facilities to allieviate this.</p>\n<p>The <code>g!</code> is an operator that replaces the text with evaluated Vimscript.\nFor example, running <code>g!!</code> on the line <code>1 + 1</code> would change the line to <code>2</code>.</p>\n<p><code>:PP</code> opens a REPL for evaluating Vimscript.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-vim\">:PP\nPP&gt; <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">system</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'ls'</span>)\n<span

of functionality, and its smart to leverage it.\nCalling <code>system</code> exposes unix commands to vim.</p>\n<pre><code>echo(<span class=\"hljs-name\">system</span>('ls'))\necho(<span class=\"hljs-name\">system</span>('ls -lal '.expand('%')))\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Resources</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><code>:h system</code></li>\n<li><a

Commands</a></li>\n<li><code>:h expand</code></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>State Up To Date</h2>\n<p>The key to Vimscript is understanding how to manipulate vim's state.\nThere are 3 main ways to interact with application state in vim:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Passively reading current state</li>\n<li>Updating state</li>\n<li>Binding to an <a href=\"http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/autocmd.html#autocmd-events-abc\">event</a> broadcasted when state changes</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most Vimscript functionality employs one of these interactions.</p>\n<h3>Reading State</h3>\n<p>Variables govern the state and behavior of vim.\nVariable namespacing is systematic in Vimscript.\nHere are the different types of variables:</p>\n<p><strong>g:variables</strong> - global variables<br>\nGlobals preserve value in any situation within vim.\nThis means any mode, and any buffer.\nA frequent use of these variables is to memoize plugin loading.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-meta\">:echo(g:loaded_fugitive)</span>\n&gt; 1\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>s:variables</strong> - script local<br>\nThese variables have scope limited to their file.\nThis allows 2 scripts to have the same variable, but not collide.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-vim\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">s:counter</span> = <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>! <span class=\"hljs-title\">MyCounter</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span></span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">s:counter</span> = <span class=\"hljs-variable\">s:counter</span> + <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">echo</span>(<span class=\"hljs-variable\">s:counter</span>)\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">endfunction</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>b:variables</strong> - buffer local<br>\nThese variables bind to the current buffer.\nSyntax specific functionality is a great usecase for them.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-vim\">:<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">echo</span>(<span class=\"hljs-variable\">b:did_ftplugin</span>)\n&gt; <span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>$VARIABLES</strong> - Environment<br>\nAll environment variables carry over from the shell.\nLike the shell, dollar signs ($) prefix environment variables.</p>\n<pre><code>:<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">echo</span>(<span class=\"hljs-variable\">$PAGER</span>)\n&gt; less\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>&amp;variables</strong> - Set options<br>\nCalling <code>set filetype=markdown</code> is a wrapper to vim's option variables.</p>\n<pre><code>:echo(&amp;tabstop)\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">&gt;</span><span class=\"bash\"> 2</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>@variable</strong> - register variables<br>\nThe registers are global containers to save values.\nMacros save into single digit global registers(0-9a-z).\nAccess to these registers via <code>@</code> in Vimscript.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-symbol\">:let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">@d</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">'ggdG'</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-symbol\">:echo</span>(<span class=\"hljs-variable\">@d</span>)\n&gt; ggdG\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Buffer State</h4>\n<p>Some buffer state is not available via variables.\nThis makes vim faster because it does not need to constantly write changing data.\n<em>It will lazy-load this information via certain functions it provides.</em>\nConsider this example of reading the current line:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-vim\">:<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">echo</span>(<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">line</span>(<span class=\"hljs-string\">'.'</span>))\n&gt; <span class=\"hljs-number\">262</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Resources</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><code>:h variables</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/19.html\" title=\"Learn Vimscript The Hard Way - Variables\">Learn Vimscript The Hard Way - Variables</a></li>\n<li><code>:h line</code></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Updating State</h3>\n<p>Whenever you interact with vim you are updating runtime state.\nA call to <code>:set filetype=markdown</code> will update the <code>&amp;filetype</code> variable.\nTyping <code>gg</code> will move the current line.\n<code>:w</code> tells vim to execute its buffer writing sequence.</p>\n<p>State updates are similar in Vim and Vimscript.\nThe main ways to update state are as follows:</p>\n<p>(Note <code>.</code> concats <a href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/26.html\" title=\"Learn Vimscript The Hard Way - Strings\">strings</a> in Vimscript)</p>\n<p><strong>let</strong> - updates a variables state</p>\n<pre><code>   <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> &amp;<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">filetype</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">'markdown'</span>\n   <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"hljs-variable\">g:script_loaded</span>=<span class=\"hljs-number\">1</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>execute</strong> - evaluates a string as an ex (:) command</p>\n<pre><code>  <span class=\"hljs-built_in\"> execute </span><span class=\"hljs-string\">\":w \"</span>.expand('%')\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>normal!</strong> - executes commands as if a user typed them</p>\n<pre><code>   normal! gg=G\n  <span class=\"hljs-built_in\"> execute </span><span class=\"hljs-string\">\"normal! \"</span>.commands\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>eval</strong> - evaluates a string as Vimscript</p>\n<pre><code>   <span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">eval</span>('let <span class=\"hljs-variable\">@r</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"gg=G\"</span>)\n</code></pre>\n<h4>Resources</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><code>:h :set</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/02.html\"

events by subscribing to them.</p>\n<h4>Keyboard Events</h4>\n<p>Vim has 2 main modes for subscribing to keyboard events: <a href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/03.html\" title=\"Learn Vimscript The Hard Way - Basic Mapping\">mappings</a>, and <a href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/08.html\" title=\"Learn Vimscript The Hard Way -

mode-specific:</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-meta\">:map  &lt;f12&gt; :h&lt;cr&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-meta\">:imap &lt;c-c&gt; &lt;esc&gt;:w&lt;cr&gt;</span>\n:nmap ZJ

them with the world.\nThe easiest way to share is via <a href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/42.html\" title=\"Learn Vimscript The Hard Way - Plugin Layout in the Dark Ages\">plugins</a>.</p>\n<h2>Structuring</h2>\n<p>In general, there are 2 main types of <a href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/42.html\" title=\"Learn Vimscript The Hard Way

href=\"https://github.com/tommcdo/vim-exchange\">vim-exchange</a>), and filetype specific (<a href=\"https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails\">vim-rails</a>).\nThe structure can vary, but here is a simplified template for each:</p>\n<h3>Global Plugin</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>doc</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/53.html\" title=\"Learn Vimscript The Hard Way - Autoloading\">autoload</a></li>\n<li>plugin</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For a global plugin, the general formula is simple: expose your plugin within the plugin directory, and autoload everything else.\nWhen starting out, <a href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/53.html\" title=\"Learn Vimscript The Hard Way - Autoloading\">autoload</a> may be overkill, but read <code>:h

href=\"http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/chapters/42.html\" title=\"Learn Vimscript The Hard Way - Plugin Layout in the Dark Ages\">Plugins</a> should memoize themselves (unless under development).\nTo make sure they don't load twice, guard files with a snippet like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-vim\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> <span

your keyboard layout exercises getting out of your comfort zone, improves comfort and efficiency","revision":13},"body":"<h1>Goodbye Comfort</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Playfully doing something difficult, whether useful or not, that is hacking&quot;\n~ Richard Stallman</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Leaving your comfort zone is a muscle that grows with training.\nThe effort is worthwhile as there are many advantages when comfort is abandoned.\n<a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/the-science-of-breaking-out-of-your-comfort-zone-and-w-656426705\">This lifehacker article</a> outlines a handful of benefits attributed to pushing your comfort level:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>&quot;You'll be more productive&quot;</em></li>\n<li><em>&quot;You'll have an easier time dealing with new and unexpected changes&quot;</em></li>\n<li><em>&quot;You'll find it easier to push your boundaries in the future&quot;</em></li>\n<li><em>&quot;You'll find it easier to brainstorm and harness your creativity&quot;</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I keep my eyes open for opportunities to step out of my comfort zone.\nWhen exposed to the idea of changing keyboard layouts, a signal flashed in my mind.\n<em>As a programmer, typing occupies a large portion of my day.</em>\nAs such, learning a new layout costs virtually no time.</p>\n<p>I began learning Dvorak in late 2015.\n<em>I expected comfort and speed to increase, but the speed increase was negligable.</em>\nDespite its failure to improve speed, it still was a great exercise in learning a new skill, and obtaining a new perspective.</p>\n<p>This article shares the insights gained during the exercise.</p>\n<h1>Choosing The Right Thing To Learn</h1>\n<p>Dvorak is not the only competition to qwerty.\nWhen I started to read about the layout, I learned that there are other keyboard layouts.\nEach claims its own advantage over the others, and I found myself in a loop of decidophobia\nI was considering the following layouts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>colmark</li>\n<li>dvorak</li>\n<li>programmers dvorak</li>\n<li>workman</li>\n<li>qwerty</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This widget compares each of these layouts.</p>\n<iframe height=230 width='100%' src='/misc/keyboardLayout.html'></iframe>\n<h2>Quantifiers</h2>\n<p>To get clarity, I quantified my decision.\nI broke out each layout into the following elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Availability\">Availability</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Ergonomicality\">Ergonomicality</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Familiarity\">Familiarity</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Usability\">Usability</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Availability</h3>\n<p>Some layouts are easier to enable than others.\nAs an example, <em>Dvorak and Qwerty are both ANSI certified.</em>\nThis means switching to the layout typically takes about 30 seconds.\nOther layouts prove more difficult.\nHowever, <em>more exotic layouts claim more efficiency and comfort.</em></p>\n<h3>Ergonomicality</h3>\n<p>A layout that is more ergonomic provides <em>improved comfort, efficiency, and speed</em>.\nIt also <em>reduces the risk of typing related diseases</em> like carpel tunnel.\nMost layouts claim to be more ergonomic than qwerty.</p>\n<p>As an example, Programmer's Dvorak tends to be the most ergonomic layout for developers.\nHowever its availability is more rare than other alternatives, and it is one of the least familiar when transitioning from qwerty.</p>\n<h3>Familiarity</h3>\n<p>Most people are qwerty users.\n<em>Some layouts share more keys with qwerty than others</em>.\nThis makes the layout more familiar, and easier to learn.\n<em>Since qwerty is the least ergonomic, many of these layouts compromise ergonomicality for familiarity</em>.</p>\n<p>I strongly considered colemark before settling on dvorak due to its familiarity.\nColemark differs in 17 keys from qwerty while dvorak differs in 33 keys.\nI still think Colemark is the most practical solution for most users.\nHowever, in my circumstance, had low usability.</p>\n<h3>Usability</h3>\n<p>Consider the applications you use most frequently.\nIn my case, its the vim text editor.\nThe Colemark layout is not as comfortable for me in the vim text editor, so I crossed it off my list despite its appeal.</p>\n<p><em>Just because a layout is generally more ergonomic does not mean it suits your specific needs.</em></p>\n<h2>Analysis</h2>\n<p>Here is a table, of my evaluations of each layout:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th></th><th>windows</th><th>osx</th><th>linux</th><th>ergonomicality</th><th>different keys from qwerty</th><th>vim comfort</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>colmark</td><td>install</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>4</td><td>17</td><td>4</td></tr>\n<tr><td>dvorak</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>2</td><td>33</td><td>3</td></tr>\n<tr><td>programmers dvorak</td><td>install</td><td>install</td><td>yes</td><td>1</td><td>44</td><td>2</td></tr>\n<tr><td>workman</td><td>install</td><td>install</td><td>yes</td><td>3</td><td>21</td><td>5</td></tr>\n<tr><td>qwerty</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>yes</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>After considering these points, <em>I decided that dvorak was the best choice</em>.</p>\n<h1>Learning</h1>\n<h2>Stages</h2>\n<p>In my experience, learning a new layout cascaded through the following stages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#Dabbling\">Dabbling</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Commitment\">Commitment</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Regret\">Regret</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Appreciation\">Appreciation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#ComplacencyFinalThoughts\">Complacency</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each stage had its own challenges and rewards.\nThese can be seen in the data that I logged during the process.</p>\n<h2>Data Collection</h2>\n<p>I wanted my experiment to answer 4 questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is dvorak better than qwerty?</li>\n<li>How long does it take to learn dvorak?</li>\n<li>Does learning dvorak hinder already learned layouts e.g. qwerty?</li>\n<li>Can I apply these lessons to learning in the future?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I collected 4 data points to answer these questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>qwerty speed</li>\n<li>qwerty error</li>\n<li>dvorak speed</li>\n<li>dvorak error</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is the result:</p>\n<div class='col-xs-6 image inline' style='float:right; margin:auto auto'>\n  <img class='img-responsive'  src='/blog/images/typing_error.png' />\n  <div class='caption'>Typing Speed Error</div>\n</div>\n<div class='col-xs-6 image inline' style='float:right; margin:auto auto'>\n  <img class='img-responsive'  src='/blog/images/typing_progress.png' />\n  <div class='caption'>Typing Speed Progress</div>\n</div>\n<p>Reading the graph shows many interesting things.\nThe next sections outline what I found at each stage.</p>\n<h2>Dabbling</h2>\n<p>Taking the first steps in learning the layout was interesting.\nIt brought new intrigue to old tasks that I performed on a daily basis.\nTyping words was extremely difficult, and nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>Here is a generalized version of the tasks I set out to accomplish during this stage:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>decide how you can get your feet wet</li>\n<li>find quick wins</li>\n<li>gain some leverage</li>\n<li>prepare to commit</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These mapped out to these in learning the layout:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>add the layout</li>\n<li>add a shortcut to toggle between qwerty and the new layout</li>\n<li>download a copy of the layout</li>\n<li>evaluate shared keys</li>\n<li>learn your computers password</li>\n<li>learn commonly used system shortcuts</li>\n<li>memorize the rest of the layout</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here are some special considerations from this list.</p>\n<h3>Freebies</h3>\n<p>Cross examine the layout with qwerty, and remember which keys are shared between both layouts.\nConsidering only the alphabet keys: dvorak shares only 2 and colemark shares 9.\nThese keys require no memorization.</p>\n<h3>Dont Lock The Door</h3>\n<p>Before learning anything else, <em>memorize your computer password in the new layout</em>.\nThis will save aggrevation, and time.\nIt is annoying to get locked out in the alternate layout without knowing the password.\nAlso, it will be the thing you type most frequently, especially if you frequestly use sudo.</p>\n<h3>Control The Ship</h3>\n<p>At this point actually writing words in an alternate layout is hard.\n<em>Let yourself fall back to write code, and prose</em>.\nHave no shame in switching back to qwerty at any point.\nEase into adding more keys to your repertoire over the first few days.</p>\n<p>The quickest, and easiest way to expand your vocabulary is to learn frequently used shortcuts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ctrl-c</li>\n<li>ctrl-v</li>\n<li>ctrl-x</li>\n<li>ctrl-w</li>\n<li>ctrl-n</li>\n<li>ctrl-q</li>\n<li>ctrl-t</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of this should only take a few days.\n<em>At this point you should know about half of the keyboard</em>.\nBefore committing, you need to learn the whole thing.</p>\n<h2>Commitment</h2>\n<p>Commit and vow to only switch back in emergencies.\nFocus on training muscle memory in the new layout.\nAfter several weeks, it will become second nature.\n<em>Accept that you will be a slow typer during the beginning of this stage</em>, but toward the end you may even be quicker than you where at qwerty.</p>\n<p>I found it essential to modify my keyboard during this stage.\nYou are committing to avoid switching back to qwerty.\nHaving <em>a visual aid on the keyboard will immensely help</em> in the beginning.\nAt first, I put hand made stickers on a cheap keyboard which I could cheat with.\nLater, I actually re-purposed the keys on my laptop to be in dvorak.</p>\n<p>During this time, I found typing training to be of great use.\nA few minutes on a practice site could work out kinks around certain key areas.\nI mostly used these:</p>\n<h2>Regret</h2>\n<p>During the previous stage, my progress rapidly increased, and it was exciting and gratifying.\nAt some point when <em>the progress plateaued</em>, I entered a stage of regret.\nMy progress was stuck at a speed less than my original qwerty speed.</p>\n<p>I tried to switch back to qwerty, but my speed was too slow.\nI regretted the decision I made to choose a new layout.\nI now liked dvorak better, and had invested a lot of effort into learning it.\nBut, <em>it did not pay off</em> yet.</p>\n<p>I got out of this rut by <em>focusing on minimizing error instead of increasing speed</em>.\nThis increased my speed and broke the plateau.</p>\n<h2>Appreciation</h2>\n<p>At a certain point I <em>reached my initial qwerty speed in dvorak</em>.\nThis was a very exciting time.\nNow instead of regretting my decision, I appreciated the things that initially attracted me to the layout: mainly the comfort.</p>\n<p>I could now continue to focus on minimizing error to get minor speed increases over time.</p>\n<h2>Complacency / Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>At the point I am at now, I am complacent with my typing.\nI am <em>~20wpm faster</em> than I was with qwerty, and have a great <em>appreciation for the comfort</em> of the layout.\nI do not see myself switching back at this time.</p>\n<p>When using other peoples computers, I struggle a bit, but it is not a huge issue.\nIf it becomes one, I simple add the layout quickly and continue to work.</p>\n<p>I mentioned in the beginning the benefits of stepping out of your comfort zone.\nWhile writing this post I had an interesting revelation: <em>after a year, dvorak is my comfort zone</em>.</p>\n<p>Now, I have been switching my layout every few days.\nThis helps keep things interesting.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n","frontmatter":"layout: post\ndate: 2015-06-24\ntitle: 'Faster Fingertips: Changing Your Keyboard Layout and Learning Techniques'\ncategories:

favorable outcomes in negotiations","revision":14},"body":"<h1>Units Matter</h1>\n<p>A negotiator with power and leverage has a better chance of reaching a favorable outcome.\nThe <em>percentage mask</em>, can be used to gain a leg up during the negotiation.\nUsing a simple rule of thumb, the technique can be employed with ease.\nIt can be used offensively or defensively.</p>\n<h1>The Percentage Mask</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Percentage Masks are caused by dissonance between perceived values and actual values.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Numbers can be framed in many different ways.\nA 5% raise on a 50k base can be expressed as: +5k; 55k; 10%; $2115 per paycheck; +$115 per paycheck.\nEach variation conveys the value differently, and carries a unique perception.\nDecisions hinge off the perception of the offer.</p>\n<p>Typically, a recipient of a raise deserves it, and the point of contention is the amount.\nA 10% raise could feel like a win, but a bump from 50k to 55k for an increased workload may feel like a ripoff.\nBoth are the same value, but the perception of the value differs.\nThis idiosyncrasy of our perception classified as a cognative bias called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)\">The Framing Effect</a>.</p>\n<p>The Framing Effect can be especially dangerous when only one of the frames is presented to the decision maker.\nA <em>percentage mask</em> occurs when the percentage option is presented in isolation to a negotiating party.\nIt alters the power balance because the value has varied appeal compared to its real number form.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we can usually mentally approximate percentages.\nHowever, the translation is not for free.\nCalculations like converting percentages to real numbers have an associated <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_accounting\">Mental Accounting Cost</a>.\nOur brains will allocate resources to translation, which could be used to maximize its negotiating position.</p>\n<p>When the real number bases are equal, another danger occurs.\n10% 10k seem equal until our brain converts the 10% to a real number.\nSince it takes our brain some time to grok a percentage, it falls susceptible to confusing its value.\n10% gets perceived as equal to 10k, even if the 10% (of 50k) is only 5k.\nThis is classified as another cognitive bias, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_illusion\">The Money Illusion</a>.\nIn conjunction with the Framing Effect, this makes lone percentages especially powerful in negotiations.</p>\n<p>With these concepts in mind, it is important to understand the perception of percentages in play during negotiations.\nDr. Timothy Heath et al. study the effects of percentages in discounts.\nThey recommend: 'if proportional (percentage) discounts are large, state them. If not, do not state them.' <a href=\"http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/jcr/22/1/90.full.pdf\">see here</a>.\nAs such, this rule should be employed in negotiations:\n<em>Seekers should solicit percentages when values are greater than 100, and the opposite is true for those offering.</em>\nThe table below outlines the possibilities:</p>\n<h1>Grid For Unit Based Percentage Masking</h1>\n<p>This is the most important takeaway from the article.\nEverything else is explaining why this table is true.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Paradigm</th><th>Unit &gt; 100</th><th>Unit &lt; 100</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Giving</td><td>Actual</td><td>Percentage</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Receiving</td><td>Percentage</td><td>Actual</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In negotiations, whenever possible, use the favorable unit.\nIf offered a 10% raise on 50k, counter with a 7k ask not 12%.</p>\n<h1>Bonus: Manipulability Indicator</h1>\n<p>Initial offers leave the negotiation at a crossroads.\nWill the counter offer be in a percentage or a static unit?\nIt is up to the receiver to properly execute the next move.</p>\n<p>Failure to do so, sends a signal of manipulability.\nConversely, properly converting an offer shows, shows prowess in bargaining skills.\nThe person translating to a favorable representation offers a question to the opposition:\n&quot;Will you concede to my power?&quot;\nReplying in favorable units conveys: &quot;You tried to distort my reality, and I do not accept the distortion.\nIf you try it again, I will do the same.&quot;\nThus offering a warning to the opposed party to try manipulation tactics.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Using the <em>percentage mask</em> as a mental model should help guide negotiations and eek out extra points each time.\nAt the very least, it should save a few points to someone else employing similar tactics.\nWhen a negotiating party is oblivious to the handicap the effect is amplified.\nUse the table provided as a rule of thumb to guide your unit choice in negotiations.</p>\n<h1>Resources</h1>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://biaslist.com\">http://biaslist.com</a> A

classy","revision":10},"body":"<h1>For The Sake Of The Song</h1>\n<p>Cover songs are a great tool.\nThey are great to mix into a live set.\nThey also provide a medium to practice arrangement without the pressures associated with arranging/performing original work.</p>\n<p>Since I began playing guitar I have use covers as a learning tool.\nThe tool still serves me well.\nI enjoy playing and arranging covers, and I constantly learn from the practice.</p>\n<p>In December 2015, I executed a rigorous cover song project called <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/richsoni/sets/my-dylcember\">Dylcember (check it out here)</a>.\nThe premise was to record and post 31 Bob Dylan Cover Songs in the month (one track per day).\nEven with my strong knowledge of Bob Dylan's song catalog, arranging and recording a cover per day was ambitious.\nEspecially having a 3 hour commute to a full time job, and family to spend time with during the holiday season.\nThis challenge was tough, but I successfully completed it.</p>\n<p>The rapid pace strained my abilities to their max.\nI was fatigued and working with no time or energy to spare.\nYet, I still had a desire to produce something I was proud of.\nThrough this dedication, strain, and repetition my skills evolved.</p>\n<p>I came up with this framework for writing covers.\nTargeted consistency prepares the creative mind with minimal strain.\nNot only is it the methodology quick, but it produces high quality covers.\nIt is very efficient.</p>\n<p>Lets get to it!</p>\n<h1>The Easiest Way To Learn A Cover</h1>\n<p>Here are the steps I followed each night:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Arrangement: Learn The Chord Changes</li>\n<li>Arrangement: Learn Some Lyrics From Each Section</li>\n<li>Arrangement: Learn Some Of The Melody Notes</li>\n<li>Arrangement: Take A Break</li>\n<li>Arrangement: Find Your Key</li>\n<li>Arrangement: Find Your Chords / Strum Pattern</li>\n<li>Delivery: Learn All The Lyrics</li>\n<li>Delivery: Discover Your Delivery</li>\n<li>Delivery: Capture The Performance For Future Reference</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The next sections provide some advice/explanation for each step.</p>\n<h2>Learn The Chord Changes</h2>\n<p>The goal here is to play along with the song without written instruction.\nPull up chords online, or learn them by ear.\nIf there are multiple sections, learn them all.</p>\n<h2>Learn Lyrics One Of Each Section</h2>\n<p>I can accomplish this in tandem with learning chords most of the time.\nThe main reason for this step is to allow you to step away from the computer.\nIt is also a general distraction to fuss over the lyrics while arranging.\nYou have to learn them anyway, so just get started now.</p>\n<h2>Learn Some Of The Melody Notes</h2>\n<p>I prefer to let my brain find the key for me.\nTo do this, you first need to know a few notes in the original melody.</p>\n<p>Find a spot in the song, the beginning or a strong part and figure out the notes on guitar in the original key.\nDon't go crazy, just learn a few reference notes.</p>\n<h2>Take A Break</h2>\n<p>Get the song out of your head.\nIts important for the next step.</p>\n<h2>Find Your Key</h2>\n<p>A little later start singing that part acapella, and then grab your guitar.\nFind the note you are singing on guitar, and adjust your capo to match the chords of that part.\nYou should know the relationship because you found the melody note earlier.</p>\n<h2>Find Your Chords / Strum Pattern</h2>\n<p>This is a very important yet often neglected part.\nFind the chords that sound the best.\nJust because you found the key by moving the capo up 3 frets does not mean you should play it that way.</p>\n<p>Maybe this song sounds better with no capo, but instead a D voicing in standard tuning, maybe its cool in open D, maybe its nice with the capo on 2 with the C shape.\nTry them all out, and try stumming patterns/tempo/rhythems with them all as well.\nThis is the artistic part of the arrangement right here.\nMake it you, make it new, make it interesting.</p>\n<p>I have discovered many awesome chord voicings from this part of the process.\nNothing crazy, here are a few I have never encountered before:</p>\n<pre><code>  A D E\nE <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">5</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>\nB <span class=\"hljs-number\">5</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">7</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>\nG <span class=\"hljs-number\">6</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">7</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">9</span>\nD <span class=\"hljs-number\">7</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">9</span>\nA <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span> x <span class=\"hljs-number\">7</span>\nE x x <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Learn All The Lyrics</h2>\n<p>This is self explanatory.\nI usually memorize each verse in isolation repeating a part 4x without mistakes, then adding a new line.\nThen do that verse and the one before it 4x without mistakes.</p>\n<p>You cannot deliver effectively without memorizing the lyrics.\nTake the time to do it.</p>\n<h2>Discover Your Delivery</h2>\n<p>Now you know all the words, and the way you want to play the song.\nFind words you want to savor, and practice their delivery.\nYou are pretty much done.\nAlthough a song is never learned, delivery can always improve.</p>\n<h2>Record It For Future Reference</h2>\n<p>Even if you do not play in releasing a recording or a video, make sure you get one for your own reference.\nAlso I recommend noting the instrumentation because you may forget it later.\nTo kill two birds with one stone, I usually PhotoBooth the performance with the guitar in frame.</p>\n","frontmatter":"layout: post\ndate: 2016-01-19\ntitle: A Recipe For Arranging/Learning

Attention","categories":[],"tags":[],"revision":1},"body":"<h1>Let My Poor Voice Be Heard</h1>\n<p>Once you become comfortable playing in front of people, the next step is to capture audience attention.\nAs with getting used to playing in front of people, the best place to do this is open mic nights.\nThe methods should be unique, as they should not tarnish your brand / your music.</p>\n<p>In general terms, you want to invoke a strong emotional response in the audience.\nThe response should be so strong, that you cannot help but listen.\nThis is why an open mic night is the perfect place to do this.\nPeople at the coffee shop / bar mostly did not come to see you.\nThey came to see their friends, or to have a coffee.</p>\n<p>Its your goal to polarize these people's emotions, and get them to listen to you.\nAny emotion is fine at the onset.\nJust get them listening.\nThen the trick is to convert those emotions into liking you.</p>\n<p>This is a two step process, and you should start by experimenting at the polarization.\nIf you are not failing at it, then you are not polarizing enough.\nOnce you can polarize, then start practicing your conversion.</p>\n<p>Its more important to polarize than for them to like you.\nYou can always convert a hater later.</p>\n<h1>All Eyes On Me</h1>\n<p>If you are playing regularly, the best way to make this switch is by adopting the mantra <em>all eyes on me</em>.\nIf you look out into the crowd, and people are not looking at you then you failed.\nYou need to polarize more.\nIterate over that.</p>\n","frontmatter":"layout: post\ndate: 2016-02-23\ntitle: Thoughts On Audience Attention\ncategories: []\ntags: []\nrevision:

Follower","categories":[],"tags":[],"revision":12},"body":"<h1>FAN = SHARES</h1>\n<p>I separate an artist's supporters into two buckets: <em>Followers</em> and <em>Fans</em>.\nFollowers form a relationship between themselves and the artist's material.\nThey purchase, listen, like, read, attend shows etc., but do it silently.\nFans are different, and more valuable because THEY SHARE.</p>\n<pre><code>Social Media Post\n  follower: likes, listens, downloads, reads\n  fan:<span class=\"hljs-built_in\"> shares\n</span>\nShows\n  follower: attends, buys merchandise\n  fan:<span class=\"hljs-built_in\"> shares\n</span></code></pre>\n<p>A fan that shares your material extends its reach to more people.\nThis makes fans many leagues more valuable to the artist.\nAn act with a small fanbase can easily compete with the reach of a large followerbase.\nThis is true both in live and online settings.</p>\n<h3>Fans Online</h3>\n<p>As a demonstration, consider the Facebook pages of both a solo artist, Alice, and a 4 piece band, The Bobs.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Act</th><th>Member</th><th>Friends Invited</th><th>Page Likes</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Alice</td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td></td><td>Alice</td><td>300</td><td>100</td></tr>\n<tr><td></td><td><em>Total</em></td><td><em>300</em></td><td><em>100</em></td></tr>\n<tr><td>The

likes.\nYet, Alice and The Bobs both have 0 fans.\nThis is a reasonable ratio because we can assume Alice and each Bob invited all 300 of their friends, and received 100 likes each.</p>\n<p>Now suppose Alice acquires 1 single fan, Carlos, who shares all of Alice's content.\nThis gives Alice the same reach as The Bobs on any given post.\nAlice obtains 1 fan, Carlos, and obtains the same reach as The Bobs.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr><th>Act</th><th>Share</th><th>Viewers Reached</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr><td>Alice</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td></td><td>Alice's Page</td><td>100 Followers</td></tr>\n<tr><td></td><td>Carlos</td><td>300 Friends</td></tr>\n<tr><td></td><td><em>Total</em></td><td><em>400</em></td></tr>\n<tr><td>The Bobs</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td></td><td>The Bobs' Page</td><td>300 Followers</td></tr>\n<tr><td></td><td><em>Total</em></td><td><em>300 Followers</em></td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The Bobs posts potentially reach their 400 followers.\nAlice's posts potentially reach her 100 followers, and Carlos' share potentially reaches his 300 friends.</p>\n<p>This is why it is so important for artists to pay attention to their view/like/share ratio for each post.\nObtaining more shares will have a positive impact on views/likes.</p>\n<h3>Fans At Shows</h3>\n<p>This idea can also be applied to live shows.\nSuppose Alice has a show, and she invites her 100 followers.\nIf 20% decide to come, that means she has 20 guests attending.\nIf her fan, Carlos, bring 4 friends that is a 20% increase in attendance.</p>\n<h1>The Takeaway</h1>\n<p>There is a difference between a fan and a mere follower.\nFollower enjoy and support your work.\nFans share and champion the work within their own network.</p>\n<p>A fan share taps into potential fans that are outside of the reach of the artist.\nFans are the key to growth.\nGrowth is the key to success.\nThe key to success is cultivating fans.</p>\n","frontmatter":"layout:

Before You Start Singing</h1>\n<p>The most important piece of a musical performance is the actual music.\nIt is the price to play.\nCapturing audience attention does not require this, but converting them to followers and fans does.\nWhich is the whole point of performing.\nMore importantly, you owe it to yourself to play something high quality.</p>\n<p>The songs you play should be rehearsed.\nThis surpasses memorization, which is why I am so confused when people bring lyrics/chords to an open mic night.\nYou are playing four songs, just learn them.\nHave you seen Bob Dylan,

Closed</em>.</p>\n<h2>4x</h2>\n<p>I am very systematic with this method.\nIts sort of a game I play.\nIt is won when the song is performed 4x in a row without looking at the lyrics, and without hesitating.\nThe 4x is arbitrary, but gospel for me.\nMeaning, I think the number could be different and still work, but I have never questioned it.</p>\n<h2>Play the whole song</h2>\n<p>Start by playing the song and reading the lyrics.\nThen close your eyes and try to play it.\nIf you hesitate or forget the words thats fine.\nJust, try as hard as possible not to look at the words.</p>\n<h2>By part</h2>\n<p>If you struggle on a verse or a line, employ the method on that subsection.\nFor example, play a line in isolation while reading it, and then repeat it 4x.</p>\n<h2>Just write</h2>\n<p>If that fails, I employ the same method, but instead of playing guitar, I only write the lyrics.\nIt has never not worked for me.</p>\n","frontmatter":"layout: post\ndate:

class=\"hljs-keyword\">is</span> Rich Soni, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">and</span> I am a <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">local</span> singer/songwriter.\nI am exploring new places <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">to</span> play, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">and</span> love <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">to</span> book a <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">date</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">at</span> your venue.\nI believe <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">my</span> experience playing <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">at</span> SIMILAR_VENUES_HERE make <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">me</span> well suited <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">to</span> perform <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">at</span> your establishment.\n\nI usually have <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">about</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">20</span> fans show up <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">to</span> each <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">of</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">my</span> shows, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">and</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">my</span> sets <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">contain</span> a mix <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">of</span> original music, Irish Songs, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">and</span> Acoustic Covers (Bob Dylan, Grateful Dead, The Band etc.)\n\nYou can find out more <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">about</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">me</span> including sample <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">me</span> music here: bandf.la/re1e95b.\n\nHope <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">to</span> hear <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> you soon,\nRich\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Crafting Your Own</h1>\n<p>There are some things that may differ in your template.\nHere are some variations I encounter.</p>\n<h2>Personal Description</h2>\n<p>I alter the <code>local singer/songwriter part</code> based upon the performance type, and location.\nSometimes I put <code>local musician</code> other times I put <code>touring singer/songwriter</code> or <code>singer/songwriter from New Jersey</code>.</p>\n<h2>Venue Name vs. Booker Name</h2>\n<p>Usually I do not know the name of the person booking the shows.\nIf I do the email changes slightly.</p>\n<p>Obviously, I address them by name in the salutation.\nI also change the sentence: <code>book a date at your venue</code> to <code>book a date at VENUE_NAME</code> since booking is often done by a promoter who handles several venues.</p>\n<h2>Bandflare Relay</h2>\n<p>In the past I had a section that looked like this:</p>\n<pre><code>\nHere are some links:\n<span class=\"hljs-bullet\">* </span>Facebook\n<span class=\"hljs-bullet\">* </span>Website\n<span class=\"hljs-bullet\">* </span>iTunes\n<span class=\"hljs-bullet\">* </span>Spotify\n<span class=\"hljs-bullet\">* </span>Bandcamp\n</code></pre>\n<p>But now, I use <a href=\"relay.bandflare.com\">Bandflare Relay links</a>.\nThis was their original use case, but they have proved to be useful for lots more.</p>\n<h1>Share your own!</h1>\n<p>Share any templates you use in the
